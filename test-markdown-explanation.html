**Explanation:** ISO's fire suppression rating schedule allots a maximum of 105.5 points, divided among four components. Of these, the fire-department segment carries the greatest single weight: up to 50 points can be earned for staffing, equipment, training, and related factors. The remaining points are allocated to water supply (40), communications (10), and community risk-reduction efforts (5.5). Because the schedule explicitly caps the fire-department portion at 50 points, that figure is the correct answer.
