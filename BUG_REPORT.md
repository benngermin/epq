# Bug Report & Fixes Applied

## Summary
I've identified and fixed several bugs in your application. Here's what I found and resolved:

## üêõ Bugs Found and Fixed:

### 1. **Module Import Error** ‚úì Fixed
- **Issue**: Dashboard was failing to load due to lazy loading import errors
- **Fix**: Added better error handling with retry logic and user-friendly error messages instead of page reloads

### 2. **Memory Leak in Stream Management** ‚úì Fixed  
- **Issue**: Active streams could accumulate in memory if cleanup failed
- **Fix**: Added try-catch protection and forced cleanup with better logging

### 3. **Dashboard Navigation Race Condition** ‚úì Fixed
- **Issue**: Dashboard could crash if course data was incomplete or missing
- **Fix**: Added try-catch block around course selection logic with proper error alerts

### 4. **Missing Error Boundaries** ‚úì Fixed
- **Issue**: Errors in dashboard could crash the entire application
- **Fix**: Created and implemented DashboardErrorBoundary component

### 5. **XSS Vulnerability in External ID Route** ‚úì Fixed
- **Issue**: External ID parameter wasn't properly validated/sanitized
- **Fix**: Added input validation regex and sanitization

### 6. **Session Timeout Handling** ‚úì Fixed
- **Issue**: 401 errors weren't handled gracefully
- **Fix**: Updated error handling to clear user data and provide better error messages

## üîç Additional Issues Found (Not Fixed):

### 1. **Potential Performance Issues**
- Multiple sequential API calls in question-set-practice component could be parallelized
- Consider implementing request batching for better performance

### 2. **Browser Console Warnings**
- Some components may be re-rendering unnecessarily
- Consider implementing React.memo for performance optimization

### 3. **Error Logging**
- Consider implementing a centralized error logging service
- Current console.error calls could be enhanced with structured logging

## üéØ Recommendations:

1. **Add Unit Tests**: Critical components like authentication and course selection need test coverage
2. **Implement Rate Limiting**: API endpoints should have rate limiting to prevent abuse
3. **Add Request Caching**: Implement more aggressive caching for course and question data
4. **Monitor Memory Usage**: Set up monitoring for the activeStreams Map size
5. **Add Health Check Endpoint**: Implement /api/health for monitoring application status

## ‚úÖ What's Working Well:

- Authentication flow is properly secured
- Database queries are parameterized (no SQL injection risk)
- React Query is well-implemented for data fetching
- Error boundaries are now in place for critical components
- Session management is properly handled

Your application is now more stable and secure with these fixes applied!
