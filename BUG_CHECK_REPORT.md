# Bug Check Report - Exam Practice Questions Application
## Check Date: August 7, 2025

## Summary
I've conducted a comprehensive bug check of your application and found several issues. Here's the complete report:

## Bugs Found and Fixed

### 1. ✅ FIXED: TypeScript Error in Cognito Auth
**Location**: `server/cognito-auth.ts` (lines 190, 192)
**Issue**: Code was trying to access `course.title` when the property is actually `course.courseTitle`
**Impact**: Would cause runtime errors when redirecting users after SSO login
**Status**: Fixed - Changed to use `course.courseTitle`

### 2. ✅ FIXED: Session Save Error Handling in OAuth Flow  
**Location**: `server/cognito-auth.ts` (line 116)
**Issue**: Session save error was returning JSON response instead of redirect during OAuth flow
**Impact**: Users would see raw JSON error instead of proper error page
**Status**: Fixed - Now redirects to `/auth?error=session_save_failed`

## Previously Fixed Bugs (Confirmed Working)

### 3. ✅ Memory Leak in usePerformanceMonitor Hook
**Status**: Already fixed - Hook properly records render times

### 4. ✅ Race Condition in streamOpenRouterToBuffer
**Status**: Already fixed - Proper try-catch-finally blocks ensure reader cleanup

### 5. ✅ Session Race Condition in auth.ts
**Status**: Already fixed - req.session.save() calls ensure session persistence

### 6. ✅ Inefficient Question Status Calculation
**Status**: Already fixed - useMemo hook properly memoizes calculations

### 7. ✅ Stale Closure Risk in Active Streams
**Status**: Already fixed - Defensive copies prevent stale references

## Non-Issues (False Positives from Previous Report)

### 8. ❌ Event Listener Memory Leak in useIsMobile
**Status**: No bug - Code correctly uses `removeEventListener` (not deprecated)

### 9. ❌ Missing Await in Bulk Import Operations
**Status**: No bug - All import operations are properly awaited (lines 2177, 2180)

## Remaining Potential Issues

### 10. ⚠️ Content Security Policy Too Permissive
**Location**: `server/index.ts` (lines 26-33)
**Issue**: CSP allows 'unsafe-inline' and 'unsafe-eval' for scripts
**Impact**: Reduced XSS protection
**Recommendation**: Consider implementing nonce-based CSP for production

### 11. ⚠️ Database Query Optimization
**Location**: Multiple queries throughout the application
**Issue**: Some complex queries might benefit from additional composite indexes
**Impact**: Slower performance as data grows
**Recommendation**: Monitor slow queries in production

## Application Health Status

### ✅ Working Correctly:
- Authentication flow (both local and Cognito SSO)
- Session management with proper persistence
- Database connection pooling with circuit breaker
- Error handling with proper retry mechanisms
- React Query caching and optimization
- Lazy loading and code splitting
- Database indexes for common queries

### ✅ No Syntax/Type Errors:
- LSP diagnostics show no errors after fixes
- TypeScript compilation successful
- All imports properly resolved

### ✅ API Endpoints Responding:
- `/api/auth/config` - Returns authentication configuration
- `/api/user` - Properly returns 401 for unauthenticated requests
- Server running on port 5000 without issues

## Summary

**Total Issues Found**: 2 new bugs (both fixed)
**Previously Fixed**: 5 bugs confirmed working
**False Positives**: 2 non-issues 
**Remaining Concerns**: 2 performance/security optimizations (non-critical)

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate**: All critical bugs have been fixed ✅
2. **Short-term**: Monitor application performance and error logs
3. **Long-term**: Consider CSP improvements and query optimization based on usage patterns

The application is now in a stable state with all critical bugs resolved. The remaining items are optimization opportunities rather than bugs.
