⏺ I need you to identify and fix the SSE streaming issue that's preventing the AI
  chatbot responses from displaying properly. The streaming endpoint is loading
  indefinitely with no content showing up, even though the server logs indicate that
  chunks are being sent successfully.

  The Problem:
  When I answer a question incorrectly and the chatbot interface appears, it just
  shows a continuous loading state. Looking at the server logs, I can see that chunks
   are being processed and sent from OpenRouter, but nothing appears on the client
  side. The issue is a data format mismatch between what the server sends and what
  the client expects.

  What's Happening:
  In server/routes.ts around line 2321 inside the streamOpenRouterDirectly function,
  the server is sending incremental delta chunks (small fragments like " requiring",
  " assumptions", " rather than") in the content field. However, the client code in
  simple-streaming-chat.tsx (line 56) is designed to replace the entire message
  content with whatever comes in each chunk, not accumulate the chunks. This means
  the displayed text keeps getting replaced with each tiny fragment, making it appear
   as if nothing is showing up.

  The Fix:
  I need you to modify line 2321 in server/routes.ts. Instead of sending the
  incremental delta (content), send the accumulated full response (fullResponse) so
  the client displays the complete growing message.

  Specific Change:
  In server/routes.ts, locate the streamOpenRouterDirectly function and find this
  code around line 2321:

  const sseData = `data: ${JSON.stringify({
    type: "chunk",
    content: content  // ← Currently sends only the delta fragment
  })}\n\n`;

  Change it to:

  const sseData = `data: ${JSON.stringify({
    type: "chunk",
    content: fullResponse  // ← Send the accumulated full response instead
  })}\n\n`;

  Why This Works:
  The fullResponse variable is already accumulating all the content from each delta
  chunk (line 2318: fullResponse += content;). By sending fullResponse instead of
  just content, the client receives the complete message-so-far with each update,
  which properly displays as a growing stream of text instead of fragmented
  replacements.

  After Making This Change:
  Test by answering a question incorrectly. The AI response should now stream in
  properly, with text gradually appearing and growing in real-time rather than just
  showing a loading spinner indefinitely.
