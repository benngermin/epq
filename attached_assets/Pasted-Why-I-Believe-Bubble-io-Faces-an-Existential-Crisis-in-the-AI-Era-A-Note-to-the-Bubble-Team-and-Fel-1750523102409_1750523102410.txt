Why I Believe Bubble.io Faces an Existential Crisis in the AI Era

A Note to the Bubble Team and Fellow Bubblers

Let me state clearly from the start: I am a dedicated, full-time Bubble developer. Much of my professional success is directly tied to this platform, and I deeply respect what the Bubble team has achieved over the past decade. I’m sharing this perspective from a place of experience and genuine commitment—not as a complaint but as an urgent warning. I strongly believe Bubble is heading toward an existential crisis. My goal here is to start an important, perhaps difficult, conversation about Bubble's future.

For over ten years, Bubble.io has been the unquestioned champion of scalable no-code platforms. It taught an entire generation of non-engineers—including myself—how to create sophisticated web applications without writing code. This visual-to-code "bridge" is the product of tens of millions of venture dollars and countless engineering hours.

However, a bridge only has value when the river it spans remains difficult to cross. Over the past 18 months, agentic coding platforms like Replit have rapidly drained that river. English, quite literally, is becoming the new API. Today, if you can clearly articulate what you need, advanced AI models will write, lint, test, and even deploy your code—eliminating the necessity of an intermediary visual layer entirely.

The Economics Are Undeniable

At the core of this issue is an accelerating technological and economic trend that overwhelmingly favors code-first, AI-powered agentic platforms over Bubble's closed ecosystem.

Consider these data points:

Inference costs are plummeting: The Stanford AI Index (2025) noted a 280-fold decrease in inference costs (from $20 to just $0.07 per million tokens) between late 2022 and late 2024 for GPT-3.5-level models.

Energy usage per query is falling rapidly: A 2024 study measured GPT-4-class queries at just 0.3 Wh each—ten times lower than in 2023.

Hardware efficiency follows a Moore's Law trajectory: GPUs' FLOPS-per-watt performance improves roughly 40% each year.

These accelerating curves mean that, every few months, a dollar buys significantly more "intelligence." This exponential improvement drives billions of dollars into the global tech race, fueling massive data centers, breakthroughs in energy efficiency, and relentless algorithmic advancements. Platforms like Replit, designed to capitalize on these developments, reap tremendous rewards. Bubble does not.

Bubble’s Structural Disadvantages

Proprietary Grammar: Bubble’s entire proprietary system—including its underlying logic, frameworks, and internal processes—is not publicly accessible, leaving frontier AI models unfamiliar with it. As evidenced by extensive testing with the best frontier models available today (e.g., o3-Pro, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Claude 4 Opus), pairing extensive Bubble documentation with intelligent reasoning models simply does not yield the same quality, capability, or effectiveness as models that have been purpose-trained on the complete corpus of coding knowledge, datasets, and publicly accessible programming information.

Release Velocity: Bubble’s visual abstraction approach requires dedicated engineering for each new feature, element, database capability, or technological advancement introduced to the platform. In contrast, agentic platforms simply incorporate new AI models already trained to intuitively understand and utilize a wide range of technical advancements. This fundamental difference creates a substantial and growing gap in innovation speed and adaptability.

Performance Ceiling: As user expectations increasingly shift toward fluid animations and seamless interactions at 60 fps, Bubble’s visual abstraction layer introduces significant runtime overhead. Direct, AI-generated code will always outperform Bubble’s visual-generated code stacks.

Two Futures for No-Code

Let's examine two possible futures over the next five years.

Scenario One (I Believe Extremely Likely): Exponential growth continues. AI intelligence continues to improve, and energy costs per token drop 10-20% annually. Platforms like Replit will evolve rapidly, becoming increasingly reliable, secure, and capable of managing sophisticated multi-agent tasks effortlessly. Imagine scaling this further: if energy costs continue decreasing, we could see scenarios where 5, 10, or even 100  intelligent agents simultaneously collaborate on a single app, dramatically multiplying productivity and innovation potential. For Bubble, this scenario is existentially threatening; its core differentiator, the visual bridge, loses relevance, forcing an arduous and fundamental reinvention to remain viable.

Scenario Two (Unlikely): Technological stagnation occurs. AI capabilities plateau around current levels, and energy costs stabilize or increase. In this scenario, agentic platforms become niche tools, while Bubble maintains  value for non-technical creators. Bubble’s position would remain relatively secure.

I  personally have very high conviction scenario two DOES NOT take place, placing all my chips on some variation of scenario one, even if subdued. All available evidence points in that direction: token prices have consistently fallen, hardware efficiency gains continue to accelerate, and there is no indication or evidence of the LLM intelligence curve stopping.

The Uncomfortable Reality

Arguments for Bubble's current strengths—deployment ease, security, and robustness—are temporary advantages, not permanent moats. Engineering challenges like these are increasingly solvable by AI-driven automation. Agentic platforms are rapidly closing these gaps in ways Bubble cannot match.

Bubble’s fundamental business model depends on being the intermediary between idea and implementation. This intermediary role is rapidly disappearing.

The trends are clear, backed by indisputable evidence: falling costs, rising intelligence, and an AI arms race that leaves Bubble’s proprietary system at a distinct disadvantage. So, I genuinely ask the Bubble team and our community:

How is this future avoidable? What scenario exists where direct-to-code, agentic AI does not eventually render visual abstraction obsolete within the next five years? I sincerely hope I am wrong, but currently, I see no alternative.

Please, show me the counterargument. Bubble built an incredible bridge, but the world is now learning how to fly.
