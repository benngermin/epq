**Objective**

Illustrate how insurance facilitates key societal activities.

Insurance is a vital component of an individual's or organization's approach to managing risk. Without it, much of what we value doing or having simply wouldn't be possible or attainable without taking on a potentially crippling amount of personal and financial risk.

**The Effect of Insurance**

Since ancient times, people have pooled their resources and shared losses from the risks they faced. Ancient Chinese traders divided their goods across multiple ships to spread out their risk of losing cargo on treacherous waters. And the Code of Hammurabi, written around 1750 BC, relieved merchants of their debts if their shipments were lost at sea. 

These were some of the earliest forms of insurance. Over time, insurance has evolved into a business that employs millions worldwide, pays hundreds of billions in losses to insured customers each year, and pumps trillions of dollars into the economy.

Part of the challenge industry professionals face in getting the public to fully grasp the societal benefits of insurance is pushing back against common negative public perceptions of the industry that aren't always grounded in reality. These perceptions stem from the intangible nature of insurance—which makes the benefits difficult to recognize unless policyholders receive money for submitted claims.

We'll explore some common perceptions of insurance and lay out facts that can help strengthen how the industry is viewed.

**Perception vs. Reality**

When media outlets report on customers' experiences with insurance, they typically cite the high premiums spent annually per policyholder to maintain required coverages, while also highlighting instances in which policyholders don't ""collect"" on their policies. Less reported is that insurers pay out a significant percentage of every premium dollar collected to insureds and claimants.

**Fueling Negative Perceptions**

Rather than illustrating the many benefits of insurance for individuals, businesses, and society, the media often describe insurance as an expensive product that's rarely used and doesn't provide a value commensurate to its cost.

**Perception vs. Reality**

When the media cite the only benefit of insurance as the payment of losses, they minimize the value of its benefits for individuals and society.

**What Do You Know?**

Insurance is all about managing risk. But what is risk?

*Feedback*

Risk is the uncertainty of outcomes. Typically, it's used to describe a potential loss and/or something (or someone) that's insurable. A risk, as it relates to insurance, only has a chance to result in one of two outcomes: loss or no loss; there is no chance of gain. 

For example, while investing in the stock market can be risky, it's not the type of risk to which insurance applies because financial gain is possible. Insurance is intended only for risks that can result in loss or no loss. So, driving a car is an insurable activity because it can result only in a financial loss or no financial loss.

Insurance is one of many techniques that individuals and businesses use to deal with the risks they face. However, it's often the technique they turn to first. The main benefit of insurance for individuals and businesses is the transfer of some of the financial consequences of a loss away from themselves and to an insurance company.

**What Do You Know?**

What's the concept of pooling, and why is it important to insurance?

*Feedback*

It's the grouping together (hence, pooling) of risks and premiums from many individuals to pay for the losses of a few—thereby spreading the risk among members of a large group. This allows insurers to charge affordable premiums and still pay for large losses. 

Pooling also helps insurers project losses. The more insureds in the pool, the more predictable losses become, thanks to the law of large numbers.

When individuals and businesses have insurance, they know it'll help them return to their pre-loss condition if they experience a loss covered under their policies. In this way, insurance reduces the cost of risk and provides peace of mind to individuals so they can go about their lives and more effectively conduct business.

Insurance also makes individuals and businesses more aware of the risks they face and motivates them to manage those risks by improving safety. For example, manufacturers develop safety features and procedures to minimize property damage and bodily injury to customers and employees. This, in turn, makes it easier for them to obtain affordable insurance.

**Making Citizens and Society More Resilient**

The insurance industry is evolving as a result of two key, overarching factors that are influencing virtually every aspect of the insurance value chain: the growing demand for risk management consulting and new technology that's helping organizations predict and prevent losses.

**The Risk Consulting Role**

The role of insurers and producers (agents and brokers) is expanding. Customers, particularly commercial organizations, no longer want to simply purchase a policy or receive recommendations about coverage. Instead, they want to work with a risk consultant—someone who can provide a customized blend of comprehensive risk management strategies and necessary insurance coverage to help them save money, improve safety, gain a competitive edge, or all of the above.

Insurers who can adopt this consultant role create a rock-solid value proposition, enabling them to forge profitable, long-term customer relationships. To start this process, insurers must gain a holistic understanding of all the variables affecting a customer's goals.

**Assessing a Customer's Risks**

**The Rise of ""Predict and Prevent""**

Helping customers manage their risks holistically involves finding ways to not only minimize and pay for losses but also to prevent them.

Enter insurtech and risktech, various forms of technology specifically designed to improve risk management efforts and insurance programs, respectively. They combine smart products, sensors, wireless sensor networks, big data, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, predictive analytics, and various other forms of data science to anticipate when losses will occur and trigger actions to prevent such losses.

**Examples of Technology Used to Predict and Prevent Losses**

This technology is the foundation of the ""predict and prevent"" mindset that's permeating the insurance value chain. The adoption of this mindset is driven largely by customer demands to reduce insurance premiums and lessen the physical and emotional fallout from losses (even when the financial consequences are transferred to an insurer). As a result of this technological revolution, insurers and insurance professionals are being challenged to adopt more of this technology and use it to fine-tune pricing and coverages, create usage-based insurance, and completely eliminate some loss occurrences.

**Perception vs. Reality**

**Summary**

When you factor in risk, insurance makes much of what we do—from buying a home, to driving a car, to running a business—affordable. It strengthens resiliency for individuals, businesses, and communities when disaster strikes. However, customers want more than coverage from insurers; they seek general risk management support to predict, reduce, and even eliminate future losses.

[b]The Effect of Insurance.[/b]

Imagine that a bonfire spreads and decimates not just one home, but an entire community. Or that a company's product injures hundreds of people, leaving them without the ability to work and care for their families. Without insurance, who could afford to pay for the financial consequences of such situations?

Insurance transforms what would otherwise be dire circumstances into manageable scenarios. Insurance protects consumers and businesses alike. A typical homeowner, for example, couldn't afford to pay $250,000 to rebuild a home after it burns down and continue to pay the remaining mortgage for the home that no longer exists. As a result, the homeowner would be left on the street without a residence, and the lender would be left with no asset to collect as collateral on the mortgage.

For this reason, lenders typically won't provide the money needed to purchase a high-value asset unless the asset is insured. Insurance provides the financial backing needed to restore a home and protect the lender's interest in the property.

Insurance also makes it possible to do things such as drive a car or start a business. It protects drivers from potentially large lawsuits if they injure others or damage property. And for business owners, the risk of starting a business would be too great without insurance. For example, without insurance to pay the costs associated with customer injuries stemming from defective products, the financial liability could drive an organization to bankruptcy.

Insurance also pumps large amounts of money into the economy. In the typical insurance transaction, premiums are paid first, and losses are paid later. Because of the lag time between these events, insurers can invest premiums and offer loans to make additional income. This drives economic growth.

Because of the many benefits it provides, insurance serves as the lubricant that keeps the gears of the economy churning.

[b]Making Citizens and Society More Resilient.[/b]

Let's say the town of Oar's Rest was ravaged by a hurricane. It has a mix of residential communities, small to midsize businesses, public schools, and public utilities. And, thanks to its proximity to the beach, the town also generates a lot of revenue from tourism, with travelers frequently visiting its restaurants and hotels.

Insurance policies will be invaluable to the town's recovery efforts. In addition to having to repair property, citizens will incur expenses for temporary housing, and businesses will experience significant business interruption losses and need to replace their inventory. If individuals, businesses, schools, and utilities don't have the funds to rebuild and recover from their losses, people will leave the area, and the economic vitality and sustainability of the community will be destroyed.

But with insurance, the town has the means to rebuild and recover. In the wake of both small, individual losses and large-scale disasters, insurers' claims representatives respond with empathy and compassion, acting as quickly as possible to answer customers' questions, investigate losses, and issue claim payments. The injection of funds provided by individual and commercial policies will help the town and its citizens regain their footing and could mean the difference between keeping people and businesses in the community and a mass exodus.

[b]Assessing a Customer's Risks.[/b]

Many customers, both individuals and organizations, are reevaluating the relationships they have with their insurers, agents, and brokers. Receiving comprehensive coverage at an affordable price is no longer the end goal—it's the table stakes. Along with insurance, customers are looking for a risk management partner who can help them tackle the multitude of risks they face.

The objective of a risk assessment is to understand a customer's activities. When assessing commercial clients, for example, this involves getting to know the organization's goals, strategy, risks, strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. Producers need to devote time to analyzing an organization's property, products, services, employees, and customers to determine appropriate strategies and coverages to incorporate into a comprehensive risk management program.

As part of this assessment, producers use checklists, surveys, questionnaires, loss histories, property inspections, and industry-specific underwriting or loss control reports. However, the assessment must also include an analysis of things like the customer's competition, regulatory environment, and supply chain.

Throughout the process, producers will want to introduce the customer to various loss control and risk management strategies. Simultaneously, producers should explain available insurance coverage options and the pros and cons of each. At the conclusion of the process, producers should summarize the findings and provide a list of suggested risk management strategies and insurance coverages.

**Objective**

Demonstrate the critical role of risk management and insurance in society.

**The Vital Role of Risk Management and Insurance**

Before becoming a risk management and insurance professional, you may have had misconceptions about the industry. Perhaps you imagined door-to-door salesmen or thought it sounded boring. However, the reality is that risk management and insurance make many things possible in our society.

Consider some examples:

1. **Entertainment Industry**: 
   - Large concerts, like those by Beyonce, require complex risk management.
   - Insurance covers potential issues like artist illness, venue damage, or injuries to concertgoers.

2. **Construction Industry**:
   - Risk management and insurance enable the building of skyscrapers and stadiums.

3. **Healthcare Industry**:
   - Healthcare risk management and insurance allow healthcare companies and providers to perform their jobs effectively and safely.

The insurance industry exists to help people take calculated risks, prevent and mitigate losses, and recover from losses when they occur. It has an undeniable positive impact on the world and its people.

**Check Your Understanding**

Let's say you're working with a manufacturing company, Roundpact, Inc., which is looking to purchase a commercial insurance policy with your organization. The company is located in Tornado Alley and, naturally, its management team is greatly concerned about how a tornado could damage its property, harm employees, and shut down operations.

As Roundpact's risk management and insurance partner, what might you want to tell the company's management team to encourage them to begin thinking about how to protect the business from catastrophes that may take place in other regions or areas of the world as well?

**Feedback**

It's not just local catastrophes that Roundpact must account for in its risk management plans; it must prepare for how catastrophes in other parts of the world could affect the organization. For example, a key supplier of parts along the Gulf Coast of Florida could be affected by a hurricane or flood, and any disruption to that business could interrupt Roundpact's business.

Helping companies identify and devise risk management strategies and insurance coverages to deal with these types of unknown exposures is a key way the insurance industry benefits society. It also helps distinguish industry professionals as critical thinkers and leaders.

**[The Vital Role of Risk Management and Insurance]**

Before you were a risk management and insurance professional, what did you think about when you thought about insurance? Maybe you had an image in your mind of a door-to-door salesman, or maybe you thought insurance sounded a little boring. The insurance industry is often misunderstood. But what you and I know, but not everybody understands, is that risk management and insurance make so many things possible.

Do you have a favorite recording artist? Beyonce? Well, without risk management and insurance, Beyonce can't do what she does best. Imagine one of her concerts with thousands and thousands of screaming fans. There's complex equipment and contraptions on the stage. Without security, without risk management, none of that can happen. If Beyonce gets sick and has to postpone or cancel the concert, there are financial implications for a lot of people involved. If there's damage to the venue or injury to concertgoers, risk management and insurance help prevent and mitigate the losses.

Let's look at another example: Construction risk management and insurance, which help make sure skyscrapers and stadiums can be built. Yet another example: Healthcare risk management and insurance help to make sure healthcare companies and providers can do their jobs effectively and as safely as possible.

The bottom line is the insurance industry exists to help people—to help them take calculated risks, prevent and mitigate losses, and then get back on their feet if a loss does occur. Our industry makes an undeniable and positive impact on this world and the people in it, and we get to be a part of that."

[url=https://learning.theinstitutes.org/mod/scorm/player.php?a=41994&currentorg=TOC1&scoid=84042]The Evolving Insurance Industry[/url][/color]

**Objective**

Explain why critical thinking skills are essential in the evolving insurance industry.

Risk and insurance professionals at all levels make microdecisions all day, every day. Each adds a building block to the foundation of the business and, depending on how well it's made, strengthens or weakens the organization.

For example, claims representatives make seemingly small decisions around how to settle minor claims, but those decisions can add up to big swings in an insurer's loss ratio over time—which, in turn, can affect underwriting strategy, marketing plans, and other decision making throughout the insurance value chain.

So, it's important that decisions are made with a critical eye toward how they will affect every part of an insurer's operation, as well as its customers.

**What Do You Know?**

What are some other examples of microdecisions that could affect an entire organization?

*Feedback*

These decisions can have far-reaching effects across the insurance value chain:

- Determining the appropriate coverage limits for an individual policy
- Choosing whether to have a prospective customer elaborate on information provided in an insurance application
- Deciding what data to include in a predictive model and where it should come from
- Determining whether a claim shows signs of fraud and should be reported to the special investigation unit (SIU)
- Deciding the best way to respond empathetically to a customer's claim
- Determining how to describe your ideal job candidate for an open position to a recruiter or hiring manager

At an insurer, nothing is performed in a vacuum. Each activity is closely linked to other activities or functional areas within the organization. So to make sound business decisions, risk and insurance professionals must think critically, be familiar with various insurer functions, and understand how their decisions will affect those functions, the individuals performing them, and customers. This is key to effective leadership.

When every area of the organization is involved and considered in the decision-making process, it allows for better decisions to be made based on better information. In addition, it allows stakeholders to challenge assumptions and conclusions. This embodiment of the critical thinking process ultimately yields a more comprehensive solution. It's also an image of the type of informed decision-making that has helped insurers evolve and overcome various challenges throughout their existence.

**Perception Versus Reality**

Let's look at some of the challenges faced by insurers and the responses industry leaders have developed to overcome them. These scenarios highlight the benefits of building yourself into a good decision maker by using critical thinking and having a holistic view of the insurance value chain.

**The Liability Crisis**

*The challenge:*

In the mid-1980s, a rapid increase in tort litigation and class-action lawsuits that resulted in large settlements led to large losses on liability policies. Some of the largest losses came from asbestos, environmental, and health risks that had been written long before claims were filed. The large losses triggered insolvencies, a drastic increase in liability premiums, and a similarly dramatic reduction in available coverage.

This made it difficult or impossible for some organizations to obtain liability coverage, thus limiting their ability to provide certain offerings, particularly in the areas of medical and social services.

**Insurers' Response**

**Apply Your Knowledge**

What's the difference between occurrence and claims-made coverage?

*Feedback*

Under an occurrence policy, coverage is triggered for losses that happen within the policy period, even if the policy has expired. Under a claims-made policy, coverage is triggered for claims that occur after the policy's coverage began (the retroactive date) and are reported within the policy's reporting period.

Why is this distinction so important? Prior to the 1980s, liability coverage was primarily written on an occurrence basis. So, if a doctor's medical malpractice in 1984 harmed a child but that harm wasn't discovered until 1999, the liability policy that was in place in 1984 would cover the loss—even if it had expired in 1985.

Claims-made policies, on the other hand, will only provide coverage for claims made during a defined reporting period, such as 12 or 16 months, thus limiting an insurer's long-term exposure to liability claims.

**The Threat of Terrorism**

*The challenge:*

Fast forward to September 11, 2001. Terrorist attacks in New York, Pennsylvania, and Virginia cause massive loss of life and property damage in the United States. The sudden, unexpected, and catastrophic events of that day resulted in enormous financial consequences, many of which were borne by the insurance industry. What has since become known simply as 9/11 remains one of the largest single insured loss events in history.

The 9/11 attacks resulted in large claims being filed across multiple lines and types of coverage that previously seemed unrelated and disconnected, such as property, liability, business interruption, workers compensation, aviation, and life insurance. And many claims came from areas outside of New York, Pennsylvania, and Virginia due to the far-reaching airline and event cancellations that followed.

As a result, insurers added terrorism exclusions to nearly all commercial policies, leaving organizations with critical coverage gaps. Reinsurers were also hesitant to insure loss exposures in areas deemed vulnerable to attack.

**Insurers' Response**

**Apply Your Knowledge**

Why are acts of terrorism inherently catastrophic?

*Feedback*

Acts of terrorism are inherently catastrophic because they are unpredictable and the perpetrators intend to cause widespread death, injury, property loss, or economic loss by exploiting targets that are not well protected from attack.

Acts of terrorism can create, whether directly or indirectly, loss exposures related to property, business interruption, reputational harm, and employee illness and injury. Additionally, significant liability loss exposures can stem from an organization's response, or lack thereof, to a terrorism threat.

**Social Inflation**

*The challenge:*

Social inflation affects liability losses, which have been steadily increasing—particularly among commercial auto, products liability, professional liability, and directors and officers (D&O) policies. Premiums are also increasing as a result, making liability coverage less affordable.

**Insurers' Response**

**What Do You Know?**

What is social inflation?

*Feedback*

Social inflation is the rising cost of insurance claims due to an increase in the number and size of nuclear jury verdicts (driven by juries' increasing distrust of corporate entities and a desire to punish them for injuries to consumers), longer legal proceedings, and an increase in tort litigation and class actions (further perpetuated by an increase in third-party litigation funding).

**Perception Versus Reality**

**Rapid Growth of E-Commerce**

*The challenge:*

The rapid growth of the internet dramatically changed customers' expectations, forcing companies in one of the most traditional and conservative industries to rapidly adapt or lose ground to those that did.

What's more, customers' demands for instant access to information and self-service tools threatened to upend how insurance was sold and the role of the agent and broker in the purchasing process.

**Insurers' Response**

**Perception Versus Reality**

**Climate Change**

*The challenge*:

Weather pattern shifts resulting from climate change dramatically deviate from historical data used to determine how likely a weather-related loss is to occur and what the severity of the loss is likely to be.

This results in insurers being exposed to more frequent and severe losses than they anticipated when they issued policies—which, naturally, increases claims costs. It also calls for dramatic changes to how insurers predict and analyze weather-related exposures, such as windstorm, wildfire, drought, excessive heat, freezing temperatures, snow, hail, rain, and flood.

**Insurers' Response**

**Coronavirus Pandemic**

*The challenge*:

In addition to the nearly incalculable toll COVID-19 has had on human life, the virus ground nearly all but the most essential businesses to a halt, kept people confined to their homes (dramatically reducing miles driven), reshaped the way employees think about work/life balance, triggered numerous business interruption claims, and threatened the reputation of the insurance industry due to the widespread denial of business interruption claims.

**What Do You Know?**

The coronavirus pandemic is often referred to as a ""black swan"" event. What is such an event?

*Feedback*

A black swan event is a highly unlikely and/or unpredictable event that has severe and/or far-reaching consequences.

At a time when citizens were reeling from the threat of a life-threatening illness, the loss of loved ones, business closures, and general uncertainty about the future, insurers had to try to preserve their reputations, defend their position on business interruption claims, remain empathetic to policyholders, and manage a workforce that suddenly had to perform most of its work from home.

**Insurers' Response**

**Summary**

As insurance professionals face new challenges in the ever-evolving insurance industry, it's important that they use critical thinking and have a holistic view of the insurance value chain to tackle those challenges and guide their everyday business decisions.

[b]The Evolving Insurance Industry[/b]

The insurance industry has faced numerous challenges over the years, requiring critical thinking and adaptation to overcome them. Some key examples include:

- The liability crisis of the 1980s led to the development of claims-made policies to limit long-term exposure.

- After 9/11, insurers worked with the government to create terrorism insurance programs and improved catastrophe modeling.

- Social inflation has led insurers to focus more on loss control, alternative dispute resolution, and policy language clarity.

- The growth of e-commerce pushed insurers to develop online tools and adapt distribution models.

- Climate change is driving improvements in catastrophe modeling and a focus on resilience and sustainability.

- The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated digital transformation and highlighted the need for pandemic insurance solutions.

Throughout these challenges, critical thinking and a holistic view of the insurance value chain have been essential for insurers to adapt and thrive in an evolving industry. Insurance professionals must continue applying these skills to tackle future challenges.

Examine the skills and traits that empower insurance leaders to rise to the challenges of a dynamic environment.

**Becoming a Key Player in the Insurance Value Chain**

[b]Becoming a Key Player in the Insurance Value Chain[/b]

One of my favorite things about our industry is how there are so many facets, so many critical roles, so many people, all with different backgrounds and skill sets. But we all work together and play an important part.

For example, actuarial science professionals, or data science and analytics professionals, bring an incredibly technical and analytical skill set to our industry: using a combination of mathematics, statistics, economics, and finance to analyze data and help insurance companies make data-driven predictions and decisions about risk.

Other professionals, like agents, brokers, sales and marketing representatives, are fantastic communicators and relationship builders, often working directly with insureds to help them manage and insure their risks.

What about underwriters? They're often detail oriented, investigative. In many cases, they take a creative, consultative, problem-solving approach to providing coverage for insureds and their risks.

And of course, claims professionals. They're at the heart of what we do as an industry, helping people put their lives back together. Claims professionals are often empathetic, communicative, and resourceful.

These are just a few examples of the important skill sets and roles in our industry. Keep in mind, many skills are transferable and interchangeable between roles, so your career may not be totally linear. Claims professionals sometimes become underwriters. Underwriters may leverage their skill sets and knowledge to take a new career step as brokers. There are endless opportunities to challenge ourselves and grow professionally in this industry.

Now, think about your risk management and insurance career trajectory, where you wanna be in 5, 10, 20 years. If you proactively learn from others--from your colleagues, other departments, other industry roles, segments, and specialties--and leverage the diversity and collaboration in our industry, it can help propel you to be one of tomorrow's industry leaders.

We've joined a great industry, and we have a lot to look forward to in our careers. What will you do next?

As risk management and insurance professionals, we have opportunities to follow our passions and become experts in our field. Maybe you grew up riding horses? You're in a unique position to help equestrians understand and manage their risks. Maybe you're passionate about art? You can become an expert in helping museums and private art collectors manage their risks.

The opportunities are endless to specialize, to help insureds holistically manage their risk, and to make a positive impact on the people, businesses, and society that we serve.

**Check Your Understanding**

Doris is a customer service representative for a large insurer. Because she's trying to advance within the organization, she thinks it would be a good career move to learn more about data analytics and data science in general. If you were her manager, what reasons could you provide to further encourage her to pursue this line of thinking?

**Feedback**

It's critical for every insurer function (claims, underwriting, sales, marketing, and so on) to include individuals who can work with data and effectively collaborate with data science teams. The proliferation of insurtech and risktech in every area of insurer operations is generating a wealth of predictive information than can help insurers more accurately assess risk, predict fraud, identify efficiencies, and set strategy. But each of these actions requires a human's perspective to make sure the data is gathered and applied in the appropriate context. As a result, those who can effectively work with data are well-positioned for future leadership roles.

"Understanding Risk Essentials","CPCU 500","10455","# Risk Classifications and Categories

[color=blue]
[url=https://learning.theinstitutes.org/mod/scorm/player.php?a=41773&currentorg=TOC1&scoid=83600]Risk Classifications and Categories[/url][/color]

**Objective**Becoming a Key Player in the Insurance Value Chain

Differentiate the classifications that help with assessing and managing risks.

An insurer may receive thousands or even millions of coverage requests, but it would not be feasible for underwriters to assess each risk from scratch. Instead, insurers group risks into specific categories with similar characteristics.

Risk classification based on shared attributes helps insurers assess and handle risks and improves risk management by enabling insurers to match risks with the most appropriate management techniques. Risk classification also helps with the administrative function of risk management by ensuring that risks are less likely to be overlooked.

**Pure and Speculative Risk**

A pure risk presents the chance of loss or no loss, but no chance of gain. Take the risk of a house fire, for instance. The house will either burn or not burn. If it does sustain fire damage, the owner will suffer a financial loss. If not, the owner's financial condition will remain unchanged. Neither outcome produces a gain. Generally, an ideally insurable loss exposure represents a pure risk.  

Speculative risk, meanwhile, involves a chance of gain, so it can be desirable; in fact, every business venture involves speculative risk. For example, an investor who buys an apartment building to rent to tenants expects to profit from this investment; however, several factors could make the endeavor unprofitable, so it's considered a speculative risk.

Several factors can affect speculative risk:

- Price risk—Uncertainty about cash flows resulting from possible changes in the cost of raw materials and other inputs (such as lumber, gas, or electricity), as well as cost-related changes in the market for completed products and other outputs.  
- Credit risk—Although a credit risk is particularly significant for banks and other financial institutions, it can also be relevant to any organization with accounts receivable.  

Financial investments, such as the purchase of stock shares, involve a distinct set of speculative risks.

**[Managing Pure and Speculative Risks]**

Insurance deals primarily with risks of loss, not risks of gain—that is, with pure risks rather than speculative risks. But the distinction between these two risk classifications isn't always precise. Many risks have both pure and speculative aspects. Distinguishing between them is important because each must often be managed differently.

For example, although a commercial building owner faces a pure risk from causes of loss such as fire, the owner also faces the speculative risk that the building's market value will change. The commercial building owner must consider both the speculative and pure risks and how to manage them.

For example, pure risk is often managed through insurance and loss prevention practices. To manage speculative risk, insureds could get a favorable mortgage and maintain the property to enhance its resale value.

**Subjective and Objective Risk**

When making a decision that involves risk, the first step is to assess the risk, which can be based on opinions, facts, or both.

Because it's based on opinion, subjective risk may be quite different from the actual underlying risk. Subjective risk can exist even where objective risk does not. The closer an individual's or organization's subjective interpretation of risk is to the objective risk, the more effective its risk management plan will likely be.

Subjective and objective risks can differ in other ways as well:

- Familiarity and control: For example, although many people think that air travel  has a high degree of risk, they're much more likely to suffer serious injury when driving their cars, despite the much greater perception of control and familiarity.

- Consequences over likelihood: People often have two misconceptions about low-likelihood, high-consequence events. The first is the ""It can't happen to me"" view, which assigns zero probability to such low-likelihood events as natural disasters, murder, fires, and accidents. The second misconception is overstating the probability of a low-likelihood event; this is common with people who were previously exposed to such an event. This perception may be enhanced by increased media coverage given to high-severity events.

- Risk awareness: Organizations have different levels of risk awareness because they perceive risks differently. An organization that is not aware of its risks, for example, would perceive the likelihood of something happening as very low.

While both risk management and insurance require objective identification and analysis of risk, subjectivity is also necessary because facts are not always available.

**Diversifiable and Nondiversifiable Risk**

Diversifiable risk is not highly correlated; its gains or losses tend to occur randomly and be isolated. Such risk can be managed through diversification, or spread, of risk.

An example of a diversifiable risk is a fire, which is not likely to affect more than a few businesses. An insurer can diversify the risks associated with fire insurance by insuring many buildings in several different locations. Similarly, business investors often diversify their holdings instead of investing in only one business, hoping that successes will more than offset failures.

Examples of nondiversifiable risks include inflation, unemployment, and natural disasters such as hurricanes. Nondiversifiable risks are correlated. For example, interest rates can increase for all firms at the same time. So if an insurer were to insure organizations against interest rate increases, it wouldn't be able to diversify its portfolio of interest rate risks by underwriting many insureds, because all of them would sustain losses at the same time.

Systemic risks are generally nondiversifiable. For example, if excess leverage by financial institutions causes systemic risk resulting in an event that disrupts the financial system, this risk will affect the entire economy and, therefore, all organizations. Because of the global interconnections in finance and industry, many risks once considered nonsystemic (affecting only one organization) are now viewed as systemic.

The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the previously overlooked risk of widespread disruption in the global supply chain. As infections and lockdowns spread, manufacturers had to reduce production or shut down entirely; demand for certain goods and services outpaced supply; travel restrictions lengthened shipping times; and nearly every sector experienced worker shortages. This convergence revealed serious vulnerabilities in the global supply chain.

**Quadrants of Risk: Hazard, Operational, Financial, and Strategic**

In fact, many of the risks that pose the greatest threats and opportunities actually fall into more than one risk quadrant. The way risks from all quadrants intersect to form an organization's holistic risk portfolio determines the strategies that can best mitigate negative outcomes and exploit positive ones.

Although there is no universal consensus about how an organization should categorize its risks, one common approach is to use risk quadrants:

- Hazard risks—These arise from property, liability, or personnel loss exposures and are generally the subject of insurance.  
- Operational risks—These fall outside the hazard risk category and arise from people or a failure in processes, systems, or controls, including those involving information technology.
- Financial risks—These risks arise from market forces on financial assets or liabilities and include market risk, credit risk, liquidity risk, and price risk.  
- Strategic risks—These arise from trends in the economy and society, including changes in the economic, political, and competitive environments, as well as from demographic shifts.  

Hazard and operational risks are classified as pure risks, and financial and strategic risks are classified as speculative risks.

While risk classifications focus on some aspect of the risk itself, the four quadrants of risk focus on the risk source and who traditionally manages it. For example, the chief financial officer traditionally manages financial risk, and the risk manager traditionally manages hazard risk.

Just as a particular risk can fall into more than one classification, a risk can also fall into multiple risk quadrants. For example, embezzlement by an employee can be both a hazard risk, because it is an insurable pure risk, and an operational risk, because it involves a failure of controls.

Let's use examples to illustrate the differences among the risk quadrants:

- Hazard risks—A customer may be injured in a retail store, or a kitchen fire may damage a restaurant.
- Operational risks—A company's website for customer orders may go down for several days.
- Financial risks—An organization is subject to financial risk when it invests in a company's stock because the stock may increase or decrease in value.
- Strategic risks—A company could incorrectly characterize its customers and offer higher-priced merchandise in an area in financial decline.

Organizations define types of risk differently. Some consider legal risks as operational risk, and some may characterize certain hazard risks as operational risk. Financial institutions generally use the categories of market, credit, and operational risk (defined as all other risk, including hazard risk). Each organization should select categories that align with its objectives and processes.

Pechin Technologies, a manufacturer of consumer electronics, operates out of a highly automated plant in the United States. However, it buys components from three companies in Asia. Although most of its sales are in the U.S., its European sales are growing quickly.

In the hazard risk quadrant, Pechin would have property damage risks to its plant and equipment resulting from fire, storms, or other events. It would also have risk of injury to its employees and liability risks associated with its products.

In the operational risk quadrant, Pechin would have risks from employee turnover or the inability to find skilled employees. It would also have business process risk related to how it manages its supply chain and information technology risk related to its automated manufacturing process.

In the financial risk quadrant, Pechin would have exchange rate risk related to its European sales. It would also have price risk for raw materials and supplies.

Strategic risks include competition, economic factors that could affect consumer demand, and political risk arising from countries in which the company's component suppliers are located.

**Summary**

Classifying the various types of risk can help simplify risk management. Some of the most commonly used classifications are pure and speculative risk, subjective and objective risk, and diversifiable and nondiversifiable risk. Risks can also be categorized into quadrants as hazard risk, operational risk, financial risk, and strategic risk.

**Glossary**

Pure risk: A chance of loss or no loss, but no chance of gain.

Speculative risk: A chance of loss, no loss, or gain.

Credit risk: The risk that customers or other creditors will fail to make promised payments as they come due.

Subjective risk: The perceived amount of risk based on an individual's or organization's opinion.

Objective risk: The measurable variation in uncertain outcomes based on facts and data.

Diversifiable risk: A risk that affects only some individuals, businesses, or small groups.

Systemic risk: The potential for a major disruption in the function of an entire market or financial system.

Market risk: Uncertainty about an investment's future value because of potential changes in the market for that type of investment.

Liquidity risk: The risk that an asset cannot be sold on short notice without incurring a loss."

**Objective**

Apply a process for managing an organization's risks.

Risk does not operate on anyone's timetable; it's an ever-present, ever-changing mix of threats and opportunities. By helping organizations apply a process for managing their risk, insurance professionals can help them minimize risks' downside and take maximum advantage of their upside.

**Risk Management Trends to Consider**

[b]Risk Management Trends to Consider[/b]

Entertainment and events insurance has been around for a long time, but societal changes and new developments have made it a riskier business. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, recording artists were forced to cancel concerts, amusement parks shut down, weddings were postponed. In addition to the pandemic risk, active assailants present a growing threat for entertainment venues, festivals, conferences, and more.

As unfortunate as these developments are, it's important to know that new or emerging risks and societal changes present opportunities for risk management and insurance professionals. The insurance industry has, since its inception, allowed people and businesses to effectively take and manage risks. And when a loss occurs, we support insureds on what is often their worst day.

So as risks evolve and emerge, we have an opportunity to innovate, to learn, to proactively enhance existing products and create new ones that better protect our insureds and make a positive impact on society.

In its application, the risk management process is a set of interconnected and simultaneous activities, which differs from organization to organization. This is because each organization refines its **risk management framework** based on how well it's working and on significant changes in the organization's external and internal environments. The process's success always depends on effective communication and collaboration.

Let's take a look at the five essential activities of the risk management process.

**Apply Your Knowledge**

How would you describe the sequence of activities in the risk management process?

*Feedback*

Rather than a step-by-step procedure, the risk management process is really a set of interconnected activities that occur at the same time.

**Scan the Environment**

The first step is to conduct detailed reviews of an organization's internal and external environments. In the case of employee safety, for example, environmental factors include Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) requirements, workers compensation statutes, and the organization's internal procedures.

Scanning the environment includes evaluating how each of an organization's risk management processes aligns with its overall objectives. For example, an organization may want to achieve profitable growth and promote the health, safety, and well-being of its employees. The risk management process related to employee safety should therefore be aligned with the goals of both these objectives. One goal could be to reduce the number of employee injuries, which would improve employee safety and reduce associated expenses, thereby increasing profits.

An integral part of the risk management process is defining **risk criteria**. These criteria should be aligned with an organization's objectives, resources, and risk management policy.

**Factors in Determining Risk Criteria**

[b]Factors in Determining Risk Criteria[/b]

The nature and type of uncertainties that can affect outcomes and objectives. The way in which consequences and likelihood will be defined and measured. The timeframe of the likelihood and consequences. How the level of risk is to be determined. The organization's risk appetite. Which combinations of multiple risks should be taken into account. The views of stakeholders.

**Identify Risks**

The goal of risk identification is to develop a comprehensive list of risks that could affect the organization. While it isn't feasible or practical to identify all risks, it's essential to identify key and emerging risks. This process relies on several critical tasks involving communication, including:

- Asking department stakeholders the right questions to understand their perspectives on the most pressing risks they face
- Finding external experts who can spot emerging risks that the organization may not have anticipated and knowing how to ""speak their language"" to maximize interactions with them
- Collaborating with senior management and the board to ensure they identify risks associated with the organization's strategy

Identifying risk interactions is also important. For example, the risk of a customer being injured by an organization's product is traditionally viewed as a hazard risk. However, in an enterprise-wide process, the organization can identify related risks in other quadrants—such as reputational risk from publicity about the injury, which could have both strategic and financial effects, and a possible product recall, which represents operational and financial risk.

**Analyze Risks**

Risk analysis involves applying the defined risk criteria to determine the source, cause, likelihood, and potential consequences of each identified risk. Depending on the circumstances, this analysis can be quantitative, qualitative, or both. Quantitative analysis, in particular, may entail interacting with experts.

For example, if a restaurant's identified risks include foodborne illness, its insurer can help quantify the potential cost of litigation based on prior experience and by benchmarking with other cases. The effect on the restaurant's reputation, however, would be more difficult to quantify and would probably be expressed qualitatively.

**Treat Risks**

After risk analysis comes risk treatment. When no regulatory requirements are present, an organization should compare the total level of risk determined during the risk analysis with the established risk criteria. This comparison can guide risk treatment decisions.

These are the major options available for risks:

- Avoid the risk
- Modify the likelihood and/or impact of the risk  
- Transfer the risk
- Retain the risk
- Exploit the risk

After completing this comparison, risk management professionals—in collaboration with appropriate organizational stakeholders—decide where and how to apply risk treatment.

For example, if the owner of an apartment building faces an increased risk of fire because of outdated appliances in its units, it could modify the likelihood of the risk by updating the appliances and transfer some risk through insurance.

**Monitor and Review**

**Purposes of Monitoring Risk**

[b]Purposes of Monitoring Risk[/b]

Effective risk management processes include ongoing monitoring with periodic review of results. These are the key purposes of monitoring:

- Determine the effectiveness of controls.
- Obtain information to improve risk assessment.
- Analyze events and their consequences to understand trends, successes, and failures.
- Observe changes in internal and external environments.
- Identify emerging risks.

The data produced at this step about a risk management strategy's effectiveness is only valuable when it can be transformed into action by other stakeholders. So how can an insurance professional use such data as a persuasive tool that ultimately helps protect the insured?

Although conversations with decision-makers are just as vital here as they are at every step in the risk management process, dynamically updated documents can be used to promote vigilance at every level of an organization. Prominent examples of such documents include risk registers, heat maps, risk maps, and targeted communications to the board and C-suite that focus on the ramifications of strategic risks.

**Check Your Understanding**

A manufacturer has determined that it faces increased wildfire risk, so its risk manager set up a call with its insurer to discuss risk treatment. How might the manufacturer treat this risk?

*Feedback*

The manufacturer could modify the likelihood and impact of a wildfire loss through measures such as maintaining appropriate fire-suppression equipment and conducting regular employee fire drills. Insurance, meanwhile, is a means to transfer various financial risks, particularly property and liability losses.

**Summary**

A process for managing risk focuses on both potential threats and potential opportunities. This ongoing process includes scanning the environment, identifying risks, analyzing risks, treating risks, and monitoring and reviewing the process.

[color=blue]
[url=https://learning.theinstitutes.org/mod/scorm/player.php?a=41775&currentorg=TOC1&scoid=83604]Holistic Risk Identification[/url][/color]

**Objective**

Evaluate the holistic approach to identifying risks.

When you think of commercial insurance, some of the hazard risks that come to mind include fire, flood, property damage, employee accidents, and theft. But businesses face many other risks that can inflict not just physical damage but also strategic, financial, and operational harm. That's why it's important for insurers and their commercial insureds to take a collaborative, holistic approach to managing risk—and to foster the kind of communication and collaboration needed to make that approach successful.

**What Do You Know?**

Should insurers and their commercial insureds address common hazard risks separately from holistic risk management?

Traditionally, risk management has sought to prevent or minimize property damage and injuries: Companies install smoke alarms and sprinkler systems, issue safety equipment to employees, and keep machinery well maintained, for example.

But the holistic approach to managing risk is much broader, examining not only hazard risks but all areas of the business. It encompasses the analysis and predictability of business processes and organizational decisions, considering all possible results a company may experience. It mandates the collaboration of internal and external stakeholders to identify, assess, and treat risks.

Technological advancements provide insurers with more sophisticated tools to gather and analyze risk data—telematics, for example, gives insurers access to more driving data than ever before. As a result, commercial insureds can now assess the potential outcomes of a wider scope of business activities. 

With this greater analysis capability, organizations can minimize business risks and even turn them into financial and reputational gains. After all, while risk is often defined as the possibility of suffering harm or loss, an alternate definition focuses on both the upside and downside of risk, considering what might be gained by a certain decision or action.

**Defining Enterprise-Wide Risks**

The premise of holistic risk management is that all business decisions and operations carry some risk, so organizations should look beyond hazards to assess exposures from the other three quadrants of risk:

- **Strategic risk**: Uncertainties associated with the organization's long-term goals and management decisions
- **Operational risk**: Uncertainties associated with the organization's procedures, systems, and policies
- **Financial risk**: Uncertainties associated with the organization's financial activities

This comprehensive view of risk incorporates the idea that taking risks is necessary for growth. For example, a software company may take a strategic risk in creating a new product for a new market; the decision could prove disastrous, or it could generate new revenue and improve its standing in the industry.

Strategic decisions may carry a greater risk dynamic, positive or negative, than the other categories. Considering a merger with a complementary business, for example, could disrupt employee morale and customer relations, which could eventually drive the bottom line into the red. On the other hand, the merger might turn out to be a financial windfall. Analyzing the risk variables and potential outcomes increases the odds of making a good decision.

While operational risk depends largely on an insured's specific business, it typically includes factors such as compliance issues, legal issues, credit policies, customer service procedures, software tools, and many other facets of the insured's operations.

Analyzing and managing financial risks can be as simple as monitoring cash flow and interest rates or as complex as managing foreign exchange transactions. Financial risks can also involve the cost of raw materials, depreciating equipment, asset investments, loans, revolving lines of credit, and liquidity of assets.

Taking a holistic approach to financial risk may also uncover inconsistencies in an insured's loss retention. For example, an organization that is exposed to millions of dollars of risk in foreign exchange markets may find that it retains only $100,000 per loss under its property insurance policy.

Holistic risk management can also help insureds better absorb losses. For example, a large organization can use gains in one area to offset losses in another, rather than making each area fend for itself. This approach enables an organization to mitigate the negative effects of risk by analyzing and managing its risks as a whole rather than individually.

**Technology's Effect on Holistic Risk Management**

Risk management has benefited tremendously from technological advancements, in particular the increasing capabilities to capture, store, and analyze data.

The ever-expanding universe of historical data can empower decision making by uncovering previously imperceptible risk factors. The ways that technology and risk management intersect to achieve this can seem complex, but the basics are simple: vastly more and better data, coupled with newer, sophisticated software tools that analyze, extrapolate, and predict outcomes. This process is often referred to as predictive modeling.

**Apply Your Knowledge**

**Let's Hear From an Expert: Kimberly Holmes**

[b]Let's Hear From an Expert: Kimberly Holmes[/b]

I think challenging conventional knowledge is probably one of the most valuable things about predictive modeling. And how it works is you take all the traditional risk factors—risk factors that are known by underwriters and actuaries or engineers, claims handlers, and you throw them all in a pot and you do the data science, and what comes out is what is actually truly predictive of risk. Some things that we thought were predictive of risk were not at all predictive of risk.

But it also tells you the relative importance and how much difference there is. So you might have known that a certain risk factor was more important than another, but is it two times more or 10 times more? And the more you can be precise about those relationships and which of the factors are most important, the better your decision tools will be and the better your business performance will be.

How can your organization benefit from using data it collects to perform predictive modeling and manage risk?

Many recent innovations in risk data collection are the result of smart products that sense their environment, process data, and share it instantly (and often wirelessly). The network of such devices is called the Internet of Things (IoT). 

IoT devices and their interactions generate much of the data used in advanced analytics and predictive modeling.

**Examples of IoT and Telematics Devices**

[b]Examples of IoT and Telematics Devices.[/b]

Telematics in automobiles. These devices enable insurers to create a picture of an insured's driving habits by measuring acceleration, speed, braking, and distance traveled.

Sensors in buildings. Sensors can monitor things such as heat, moisture, noise, and air quality.

Drones. Insurers can use drones to take photos or videos of hard-to-reach areas to assess damage and danger.

Smartphones and tablets. These devices enable voice, text, and video communication, along with a host of other capabilities, including GPS tracking.

Health trackers. Users can measure their heart rate, steps walked, sleep patterns, and more.

Robots. Robots can assess damage and monitor hazards and environmental conditions where it is unsafe for humans to do so.

High-definition cameras with sensors. Cameras with sensors can be used to scan and inspect buildings, bridges, and other structures for signs of erosion or other risks.

Cloud computing enables organizations to store and share all this data through wireless internet and networking services. But because of the risk of cyberthreats, the data must be trusted and protected—that's where blockchain technology comes into play. It's a decentralized data-storage technology and real-time ledger that contains a secure history of transactions. It facilitates secure transactions without the need for a third party.

Because they are secure, blockchains can eliminate the need to verify the accuracy of risk management data. Instead of spending time trying to double-check past data, risk managers can focus on forward-looking functions, such as predictive analysis or forecasting.

**Check Your Understanding**

Mathias is a manager of a distribution company. To date, the company has primarily focused on managing the risks associated with common hazards, such as fire and employee theft. A consultant from the company's insurer, however, wants to encourage a more holistic approach to risk management. Explain the difference between traditional risk management and holistic risk management.

**Summary**

Organizations are subject to a myriad of risks beyond traditional insurable hazards like fire, flood, and property damage. That's why it's important for them to implement a more holistic approach to managing strategic, operational, and financial risk. This holistic approach is fueled by the capture, storage, and analysis of data and incorporates advanced mathematical measurements and techniques."

[color=blue]
[url=https://learning.theinstitutes.org/mod/scorm/player.php?a=41760&currentorg=TOC1&scoid=83574]Property Loss Exposures[/url][/color]

**Objective**

Examine the sources of risk that affect property exposures.

After identifying the property risk exposures an organization faces, you'll need to consider the sources of risk that could affect those exposures. For example, knowing that the parking lot for a fleet of delivery vehicles floods easily in severe storms is not enough. The next step is figuring out how to deal with the flooding issue.

Categorizing sources of risk can help manage risk exposures. Although no set approach to this is infallible, physical risks can generally be broken into two categories: natural and human.

**What Do You Know?**

How might risk management address natural risk sources?

Feedback: Natural risks can't be controlled, so the most effective risk management strategies for treating them involve using loss-reduction methods.

**Natural Risk Sources**

Nearly all individuals and organizations have property loss exposures that could result in serious financial consequences. For example, a family's home could be destroyed by a windstorm, or a retail market's goods could be damaged in a flood. Other natural perils known to cause property damage include freezing, sinkholes, and vermin infestation.

Natural risks are largely beyond human control. Consequently, risk management has little, if any, effect on reducing the likelihood of a related events. However, organizations can implement loss-reduction measures to control the consequences of any such events. 

For example, a manufacturer located in Nebraska may not think that hurricanes and earthquakes present much of a threat to its operations. But, a global view of company operations would reveal that materials vital to the manufacturer's operations come from a supplier in South Florida. Additionally, some of the manufacturer's main customers reside in Japan, where a substantial risk of earthquake could disrupt supply lines. 

Armed with this information, the manufacturer could adjust plans around its secondary suppliers and market-scaling abilities, as necessary and appropriate.

**Let's Hear From an Expert: Hank Watkins**

[b]Let's Hear From an Expert: Hank Watkins[/b]

So some of the most critical risks that economies and communities are facing these days have to deal with again, I mentioned our city risk index looks at natural and man made catastrophes, it's where you're located geographically. There are very few parts of North America, for example, in the US and Canada that are not impacted by natural catastrophe.

I'd have to say because of the infrastructure that we've built up over the past century, the amount of values on our coastlines, we are most at risk for major catastrophes of any country in the world naturally primarily. But you look at some of the Asian cities that have equally a lot of risk, some of them more because of interstate conflict, some of them border. More aggressive states over there that are threatening countries have a major impact on the GDP and the human welfare of those countries as well.

**Apply Your Knowledge**

What are some financial consequences individuals and families can face if their property is damaged or destroyed?

Feedback: Damaged or destroyed property can result in any of these outcomes:

- Reduction in property value—The difference between the value of the property before the loss (pre-loss value) and after the loss (post-loss value)
- Increased expenses—Expenses in addition to normal living expenses that are necessary because of the loss, such as the cost of renting a hotel room following a house fire
- Lost income—Loss of income that results when property is damaged or destroyed, such as the loss of rent that can be collected on a property that is damaged by a hurricane

**Human Risk Sources**

Human risk sources include deliberate acts of individuals or groups, as well as events that are not deliberate but involve some element of human intervention. Examples include terrorism, vandalism, and explosion.

Risk-control techniques can usually manage the likelihood and consequences of human risk sources to some extent. For example, adopting security measures and limiting public access could help protect the Nebraska manufacturer from on-site vandalism and terrorism risks.

**Check Your Understanding**

Springer's Attire is a chain of menswear stores located throughout the state of Florida. Identify the types of natural risk sources a risk manager will need to account for when creating a risk management program for this retailer.

Feedback: Because Springer's Attire has store locations throughout Florida, it is susceptible to various natural risk sources, such as windstorms, hurricanes, floods, lightning, and natural fires.

**Summary**

Risk management professionals should consider the risk sources that may affect identified property risk exposures. Categorizing risk sources can provide a framework for managing those exposures. Although no approach to categorizing risk sources is completely satisfactory, categorizing according to natural or human factors encompasses many risk sources that might affect property.

**Glossary**

Property loss exposure: A condition that presents the possibility that a person or an organization will sustain a loss resulting from damage (including destruction, taking, or loss of use) to property in which that person or organization has a financial interest.

[color=blue]
[url=https://learning.theinstitutes.org/mod/scorm/player.php?a=41761&currentorg=TOC1&scoid=83576]Liability Loss Exposures[/url][/color]

**Objective**

Examine the sources of liability risk that affect individuals and operations.

All individuals, families, and organizations have liability loss exposures. Knowing the legal bases for and financial consequences of these loss exposures is critical to identifying and addressing them.

While the most common personal liability loss exposures for property owners are related to slip-and-fall injuries of visitors or guests on the premises, exposures also arise from off-premises activities, too—such as accidentally hitting a bystander with a golf ball while golfing, shooting somebody in a hunting accident, or hitting someone while riding a skateboard. For commercial insureds, the four most common liability risk exposures include premises and operations liability, products and completed operations liability, automobile liability, and workers compensation and employers liability.

**What Do You Know?**

What types of financial consequences can individuals or families face as a result of a liability claim against them?

Feedback:
When a liability claim occurs, an individual or a family can suffer two major financial consequences:

- Costs of a legal investigation and defense
- Money damages awarded if the defense isn't successful or if the claim is settled out of court

In theory, the financial consequences of a liability loss exposure are limitless. In practice, financial consequences are limited to the total wealth of the responsible party. Although some jurisdictions limit the amounts that can be taken in a claim, liability claims can result in the loss of most or all of a person's assets, and in a claim on future income.

**Personal Liability Loss Exposures**

Liability loss typically results from the breach of a legal duty involving the ownership or use of property, as well as from contractual agreements (contractual liability) and statutory or regulatory requirements (statutory liability). The cause of loss associated with a liability loss exposure is the claim of liability or the filing of a lawsuit. 

For example, if a houseguest falls off a homeowner's deck and is injured, the guest might sue the homeowner, who then may have to pay damages for the guest's medical expenses and lost wages during recuperation. This is because the homeowner has a legal duty to ensure the deck is safe. As another example, if a renter breaches a lease agreement (breach of contract), the landlord can sue the renter for lost rental income.

Often, damages awarded in a liability judgment take the form of special damages or general damages. Punitive, or exemplary, damages can also be imposed against individuals and families.

**Special Damages and General Damages**

[b]Special Damages and General Damages[/b]

Special damages and general damages are two types of compensatory damages that can be awarded in a liability judgment. Special damages are out-of-pocket expenses that can be calculated with precision, such as medical bills and lost wages. General damages are more subjective and can include pain and suffering, emotional distress, and loss of companionship. Both types of damages aim to compensate the injured party for their losses.

The resolution of liability disputes between individuals and the indemnification for wrongs committed against individuals are within the scope of civil law. By contrast, criminal law deals with conduct that endangers the public welfare, such as the crimes of murder, rape, and fraud. Because such criminal acts are generally not the subject of insurance, civil law provides the legal foundation of insurance. The most common personal liability claims that fall under civil law involve tort liability, contractual liability, and statutory liability. 

An individual may face a claim for tort damages based on an act of negligence, intentional tort, or strict liability.

**Check Your Understanding**

Feedback:
Even if Declan isn't found to be liable for the injury to Marcus, he faces legal defense costs. If he is found to be liable, he faces having to pay damages to Marcus, which can include special, general, and punitive damages.

**Commercial Liability Loss Exposures**

Commercial liability loss exposures are potential losses that can occur when an organization is held legally liable to another individual or organization for injury or damage. Being able to identify these exposures helps prepare for or prevent the occurrence of a loss. Let's take a look at the four most common.

**Premises and Operations Liability**

The premises and operations liability loss exposure relates to liability arising from bodily injury or property damage caused either by an accident on an organization's owned, leased, or rented premises or by an accident that arises from the organization's ongoing (as opposed to completed) operations but occurs away from the premises. An organization's liability for such accidents is usually based on negligence: the organization's failure to exercise the appropriate degree of care owed to a person under the circumstances.

In some cases, premises and operations liability can be based on strict liability. For example, a blasting contractor could be held strictly liable for unintentional damage to buildings near the blasting operations. It can also apply to liability assumed by a land owner or occupier under hold-harmless agreements in contracts such as leases of premises, maintenance agreements, and construction contracts.

**Products and Completed Operations**

Liability for products and liability for completed operations are often treated as components of one loss exposure. However, each type of liability has distinguishing characteristics.

[b]Characteristics of Products and Completed Operations Liabilities[/b]

Products liability arises out of the manufacture, distribution, or sale of an unsafe, dangerous, or defective product and the failure of the manufacturer, distributor, or retailer to meet its legal duties to the user or consumer of the product. In products liability actions, the plaintiff must prove that the defendant failed to take reasonable care in the design, manufacture, distribution, or sale of the article that caused the injury.

Completed operations liability is the legal responsibility of a contractor or other entity for bodily injury or property damage arising out of the entity's completed work. For example, a family was hosting a picnic in their backyard. A wooden deck completed a few weeks earlier by a contractor collapsed under some guests, who were injured. The family and guests sued the decking contractor for payment of their resulting medical expenses and loss of income.

Many products liability lawsuits are based on strict liability in tort. Unlike negligence actions, under strict liability in tort, the conduct of the manufacturer, distributor, or retailer is irrelevant, and the focus is on the safety of the product itself. In a similar sense, some courts also apply the strict liability in tort theory in completed operations cases in the same way the theory is used to hold a product manufacturer liable to a consumer or user.

**Automobile Liability**

Automobile liability is legal responsibility for bodily injury or property damage arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of automobiles. 

Under the common law, ownership of an auto does not automatically make the owner liable for injury or damage caused by someone else's negligent operation of the vehicle. However, most states have enacted laws making an auto owner liable for damages arising from any person's operation of the auto with the owner's express or implied permission. 

Auto liability loss can also arise from negligent maintenance of an auto. For example, if the owner of a truck fails to properly maintain its brakes or tires, this may be the proximate cause of the truck's collision with another vehicle.

Anyone who is injured or whose property is damaged as a result of the negligent use of an auto has a right of action against the operator. In addition, any person or organization legally responsible for the operator's conduct can be held jointly liable. For example, an employer can be held jointly liable for its employee's negligent operation of an auto during the course of employment. However, if an employee substantially deviates from the scope of employment, the employer is not usually liable.

Additionally, a person who negligently furnishes a defective auto to another person may be held liable to a third person injured as a proximate result of the defect. However, some courts may make an exception to this rule in cases involving a used auto sold ""as is,"" on the theory that the buyer understands (or can reasonably be expected to understand) that the auto has not been inspected for defects and should be inspected by the buyer before being put into use.

**Check Your Understanding**

Julien is a truck driver for a commercial trucking company. His employer asks him to drive a truck to a warehouse several hours away. Julien substantially deviates from the prescribed route to rest at a relative's house. On his way to the relative's house, Julien causes an accident and injures another driver. Would the employer be liable for this accident?

Feedback:
Chances are the employer would not be liable for this accident because Julien deviated substantially from the scope of his employment.

**Workers Compensation and Employers Liability**

An employer's responsibility to pay claims under the various state and federal workers compensation statutes is a common example of liability imposed by statute. The typical workers compensation statute is intended to provide an ""exclusive remedy"" for occupational injury or illness to all employees subject to the law. This means that workers compensation insurance benefits are intended to be the only remedy available to pay for employee injuries that are sustained in the scope of employment, regardless of which party is at fault.

However, employees may have other remedies available to them depending on the circumstances of their occupational injuries. An employer may also be held liable, in addition to payments required by workers compensation statutes, for the occupational injuries or illnesses of its employees as a result of tort lawsuits or hold-harmless agreements.

Feedback:
This is an example of premises and operations liability. This exposure can arise from bodily injury caused by an accident that occurs on an organization's premises.

# Summary

Individuals and families can be sued for injuring another party or damaging another party's property. For commercial entities, the most common liability loss exposures can be categorized as premises and operations liability, products and completed operations liability, automobile liability, and workers compensation and employers liability. When involved in a liability lawsuit, defendants may be responsible for paying legal defense costs, as well as special, general, and/or punitive damages.

**Objective**

Assess the managerial and human resource risks faced by organizations.

While it may be true that an organization's employees are its greatest asset, they can also be one of its greatest risks when it comes to potential liability.

An organization must carefully manage the actions of its management team, its employment practices, and its fiduciary responsibilities to avoid incurring damages that could destabilize the organization and keep it from reaching its goals. While it's impossible to note all the management liability and human resource risks the average organization faces, a few are important enough to warrant a closer look.

**What Do You Know?**

What is the difference between work-related injuries and illnesses?

*Feedback*
An on-the-job injury is usually caused by an external physical force, resulting in a laceration, fracture, contusion, or amputation. By contrast, a work-related illness usually develops more slowly, as a result of an organic or inorganic agent being absorbed, ingested, inhaled, or injected by an employee.

**Directors and Officers Liability Risks**

Properly managing the risks posed by managerial decisions and actions requires understanding the roles directors and officers play within an organization. While these roles can vary from organization to organization, boards of directors generally establish corporate policy and appoint executive officers—such as the chief executive officer (CEO), president, secretary, treasurer, and so forth—to run the day-to-day operations. Although noncorporate entities also have boards of directors with the same responsibilities, the titles of their officers may differ.

**Responsibilities of Corporate Directors**

When directors and officers fail to fulfill their responsibilities and duties as required under the law, they can be held liable for losses that result. The major responsibilities of corporate directors include:

- Establishing the corporation's basic goals and broad policies.
- Electing or appointing the corporate officers; advising them, approving their actions, and auditing their performance. 
- Safeguarding and approving changes in the corporation's assets.
- Approving important financial matters and ensuring that proper annual and interim reports are given to stockholders.
- Delegating special powers to others to sign contracts, open bank accounts, sign checks, issue stock, obtain loans, and conduct any activities that may require board approval.
- Maintaining, revising, and enforcing the corporate charter and bylaws.
- Perpetuating a competent board by conducting regular elections and filling interim vacancies with qualified persons.
- Fulfilling their fiduciary duties to the corporation and its stockholders.

The fiduciary relationship is the most important aspect of the corporation when it comes to analyzing the directors and officers (D&O) liability risk exposures. In addition to performing specific functions, directors and officers occupy a position of trust for stockholders and the general public. Fiduciary duty is a common source of risk for directors and officers. Fiduciary duties include:

**Duty of care**

Directors and officers are expected to act in good faith and in what they reasonably believe is the organization's best interest. They're expected to approach their responsibilities with informed judgment and the degree of care that any person in a similar position would believe to be reasonable.

**Duty of loyalty**

Directors and officers cannot take business opportunities away from the company they work for. In other words, a company's CEO can't direct a client  to a failing competitor owned by his nephew. They must also remain loyal to stockholders in the sense that they cannot use insider information to profit from the sale or purchase of company stock.

**Duty of disclosure**

Directors and officers must disclose material facts to all people who have a right to know them and would not otherwise have access to them. For example, directors and officers have a duty to publicly disclose facts that are material to stockholders, bondholders, and potential investors in the securities of the corporation.

**Duty of obedience**

Some authorities also impose a duty of obedience (that is, obedience to the law) on directors and officers. Directors and officers are required to perform their duties according to federal and state laws and the terms of the corporate charter.

**Employment Practices Liability Risks**

Employers face employment practices liability (EPL) risks under a variety of national and local laws. These are the major types of EPL risks organizations can face:

**Discrimination**

While overt discrimination is easily observable, disparate treatment and disparate impact may be more difficult to identify. Disparate treatment results when one individual is treated differently than others in similar situations (such as a female employee being berated for poor punctuality when male employees are not), and disparate impact occurs when policies that apply to everyone inadvertently exclude a certain group (such as requiring all employees to attend a particular religious service, which may create a disadvantage for applicants who follow a different faith).

**Wrongful termination**

Many wrongful termination claims involve charges of discrimination, but it is possible to bring them for other reasons. Traditionally, the legal doctrine of employment at will has allowed employers or employees to terminate the private employment relationship with or without cause at any time.

**Sexual harassment**

Employees who make unwanted sexual advances or demands create significant financial and reputational risks for their organization. Some sexual harassment risks come from the perception that the employer created a hostile work environment, which exists when an employee is subjected to such severe or pervasive sexual harassment that it alters the conditions of employment and creates an abusive working environment. Isolated incidents, however, are insufficient to establish a hostile work environment.

**Retaliation**

This risk arises from the possibility that a member of an organization's management team will retaliate against an employee because of a legitimate action taken by the employee. Retaliation claims may be combined with claims of discrimination based on race, gender, age, or another protected classification. Retaliation can also be alleged by employees who, for example, believe they were discharged because they filed a workers compensation claim, testified against the employer in a legislative or court hearing, or were whistleblowers (who are protected by many federal and state laws).

These classifications are not mutually exclusive. An employee may allege that a particular situation involves more than one employment-related offense. Additionally, in recent years, employees have made EPL claims that do not fall within the context of discrimination, wrongful termination, sexual harassment, or retaliation.

For example, costly litigation has ensued after firms have closed plants or otherwise discharged large numbers of employees at one time. Another example is class-action lawsuits on behalf of employees who allege that they did not receive overtime compensation. Many such claims have resulted in substantial awards. Employee claims have also arisen from objectionable email or website material sent by other employees.

**Apply Your Knowledge**

What are some factors a court would consider before determining whether a workplace has a hostile working environment?

*Feedback*
In determining whether a workplace has a hostile work environment, courts consider such relevant factors as the frequency of the discriminatory conduct, its severity, and whether it unreasonably interferes with the employee's work performance.

**Risks Related to Fiduciary Duties**

Fiduciary liability risks stem from the possibility that beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan (such as active employees or retirees) may file a lawsuit against the plan officials (or fiduciaries) for breach of their fiduciary duties. For example, if an employee retirement plan that is heavily invested in company stock loses millions of dollars in value, the plan participants may file class-action fiduciary liability lawsuits against the fiduciaries of these plans.

The duties of a plan fiduciary are comparable to those of a corporate director:

**Loyalty**

A fiduciary's actions must be solely in the best interests of the plan and all participants and beneficiaries.

**Prudence**

A fiduciary must carry out duties with the care, skill, judgment, and diligence of a prudent person familiar with such matters.

**Diversification**

A fiduciary must ensure that the plan's investments are sufficiently diversified to minimize the risk of large losses.

**Adherence**

A fiduciary must act according to the plan documents and applicable law. If the plan document is not in compliance with the law, the fiduciaries must follow the law and bring the plan document into compliance.

These duties imply a relatively high standard of care. The duty of loyalty may present difficult issues for fiduciaries who also are officers, directors, or employees of the employer that sponsors the plan. They cannot consider the potential effect on the employer when making a decision as a prudent independent fiduciary.

**Human Resource Risk**

Although human resource risks originate from many sources, three are prevalent.

**Work-Related Injury and Illness**

Usually, injuries are caused by an external physical force exerting stress on the human body, such as a box falling off a shelf and landing on an employee. Illnesses, in contrast, tend to happen more gradually than injuries, resulting over time as a consequence of exposure to a harmful foreign agent (through ingestion, inhalation, or something similar).

Although these major categories of work-related injury are most prevalent in the manufacturing and retail fields, every organization should keep them in mind:

**Machinery and equipment use**

This includes all mechanical devices that employees use or come in contact with on the job.

**Materials handling**

Because raw materials, works in process, and finished goods can be heavy, bulky, and awkward to move, they have considerable potential for causing injury.

**Vehicle fleet operations**

Risks to drivers, passengers, and the vehicles themselves have many origins. Injuries can occur both when the vehicle is in motion, and when standing still (such as a mechanic injuring himself during routine maintenance work).

**Physical condition of premises**

If floors, steps, and other surfaces are not properly maintained, they could cause injuries due to slips and falls.

Illness risks present a cause of concern because organizations can be held liable for the underlying conditions or environmental and operational factors that caused the illness.

**Sources of Work-Related Illness**

[Image showing sources of work-related illness]

**Retirement and Resignation**

When an employee retires or resigns, the loss to the organization is the future value that the individual would have provided to the organization. For example, the resignation or retirement of a vice president who has specialized institutional knowledge of an organization's finances could result in a greater loss than the resignation of an entry-level employee. Either employee's replacement could reduce the organization's loss risk, but some risk will remain until the replacement employee reaches the same level of proficiency as the person who departed.

Not all of the possible reasons for an employee's resignation are within an organization's control. An employee may leave to start a business; accept a better, or different, position elsewhere; or move to another town for personal reasons, or even because of overall dissatisfaction that the employer may not be able to control.

**Work-Related Violence**

Workplace violence can occur despite an employer's best efforts to comply with its duty to provide a safe working environment. This duty includes protecting employees and visitors from both physical violence and mental harm caused by people they come in contact with during their working hours.

Beyond the obvious risks of death, disability, and injury, workplace violence can also create financial consequences, such as lost productivity, compensation for lost time, and lawsuits filed by the victim's family. Less obvious are the risks stemming from ongoing harassment or threats. Employees may become so fearful or ill that they can't work, taking frequent sick days, filing workers compensation disability claims, or even filing lawsuits against the employer.

Organizations must also consider external risks of violence. In addition to violence that can occur at the workplace, such as an armed outsider gaining access to the workplace, some organizations face the risk that employees will be kidnapped for ransom.

**Apply Your Knowledge**

What are some of the risks an organization faces regarding the kidnap and ransom of an employee?

*Feedback*
While the most obvious and serious risk is that kidnap and ransom can result in serious injury or death to the kidnapped employee, the employer also suffers a loss, either temporary or permanent, of the employee's services, which results in a reduction of workforce for the organization.

**Summary**

An organization's management team, its employment practices, and its fiduciary responsibilities to avoid incurring damages that could destabilize the organization create management liability and human resource risks.

[color=blue]
[url=https://learning.theinstitutes.org/mod/scorm/player.php?a=41763&currentorg=TOC1&scoid=83580]Operational and Financial Risks[/url][/color]

**Objective**

Assess the types of operational and financial risks that businesses face.

It's impossible for an organization to exist without encountering some form of operational and financial risk.

Because operational risk is integrated into every activity of an organization, it must be evaluated based on the organization's strategic objectives, risk appetite, and risk tolerance. Similarly, merely owning or using a financial instrument exposes an organization to financial risk, or uncertainty arising from the effect of market forces on a financial asset or liability.

**What Do You Know?**

When the United States dollar appreciates against the euro, which statement applies?

a. One dollar buys more euros than it had previously.
b. Swiss banks are forced to hedge currencies to make up the difference.
c. Imports rise because of demand for U.S. dollars.
d. There is no effect on importing companies who use U.S. banks.

*Feedback*

a. When the U.S. dollar appreciates against the euro, one dollar buys more euros than it had previously. 

**Operational Risks**

Organizations can benefit when they categorize their specific operational risks and develop a framework for managing them. In a risk classification framework, operational risks are typically divided into four categories: people, process, systems, and external events.

**People**

Although selecting the right people to hire or do business with helps an organization grow, each of these people also present downside risk. And although many risks associated with people are insurable, not all of the consequences of these risks are. For example, employee theft and dishonesty may be insurable, but risky employee conduct like rogue trading often isn't. 

Additionally, individuals and organizations can't be covered for risks and opportunities that aren't taken. For example, an employee who refuses to customize a product or service for a key customer may lose that customer and the corresponding revenue and there are no insurance coverages for that loss of revenue.

Errors employees make during the course of business can lead to significant cost, either in aggregate or from one particularly costly error. For example, if a bank employee incorrectly keys in a payment amount that exceeds the actual payment, insurance wouldn't cover the error. And if the customer notices and reports the error, the bank could suffer reputational loss.

An organization's culture can also increase risks created by employees, customers, vendors, and partners. Some organizational cultures encourage risk taking, while others prefer to avoid it. And because organizational cultures are mainly informal, they can be difficult to change.

**Check Your Understanding**

Suppose a partner at a well-known law firm is accused of employee discrimination or harassment. What's an example of an uninsurable, negative consequence that might occur?

*Feedback*

Discrimination or harassment by managers can be insured under employment practices liability coverage, but highly publicized discrimination cases can cause reputational damage to the organization and discourage highly qualified candidates from applying for employment.

**Process**

Process risk typically includes the procedures and practices organizations use to conduct their business activities. Managing these risks requires a framework of procedures and a mechanism to identify practices that deviate from those procedures. Risk often stems from the possibility that a practice will stray from procedure. Occasionally, such departures are creative and present a new and potentially more effective method. However, many create a negative risk. For example, speeding up a production process by skipping inspection procedures can result in unacceptable product failures that would have severe consequences.

**Systems**

Systems risk concerns the function of technology, its intentional or accidental failure, and security. The evolution of technology and the software it uses is one of the factors that led to greater recognition of operational risk. For example, a data breach at a financial organization in which customer records are stolen can cause a loss that might threaten the organization's very existence. 

Equipment failure also presents risk for an organization's continuing operations, both in potential income losses and in reputational loss, resulting in diminished customer loyalty.

**External Events**

**[b]External Events.[/b]**

While the first external events that come to mind might include natural disasters like windstorms or earthquakes, external events aren't always natural occurrences. Examples of external events that don't always involve natural occurrences include the temporary or permanent loss of a key supplier or the loss of a key customer. The organization may be unable to meet production or sales goals until it finds replacements.

Similarly, a local utilities failure or inadequacy could cause operational risk, such as when an electrical system overload causes production delays. Not all external events need to be natural. For example, a publisher of a software program releases a major upgrade. If an organization is dependent on the software, it may have to stop production long enough to retrain its employees on how to take advantage of the new upgrades.

**Check Your Understanding**

The chief executive officer (CEO) of a multinational organization has been in her role for 10 years. The chief financial officer (CFO) has held his position for 15 years. What type of operational risk is this?

*Feedback*

This operational risk could be categorized as people risk. The risk for the organization is specifically related to its employment of the CEO and CFO. Both of these critical executives have held their positions for some time and could choose to retire or pursue other positions. 

**Financial Risks**

Financial risk can present itself in many ways, but the main forms are market risks, credit risks, and price risks.

**Market Risk**

Market risk is the risk that the value of an investment or investment portfolio will decrease or increase because of changes in the market for that investment. Associated market risks include:

- Interest rate risk—Uncertainty over the movement of interest rates and the effect that has on the value of an investment and an organization's assets or liabilities in either direction.
- Exchange rate risk—Exchange rate changes can affect an organization's assets and liabilities value if the organization has cash flows denominated in a foreign currency.
- Liquidity risk—If an organization doesn't have enough cash on hand to meet its financial requirements, it may be forced to sell assets or holdings at a loss. Therefore, any sort of investment that can't be converted into cash quickly and without penalty creates liquidity risk.

**Check Your Understanding**

Suppose a buyer in the U.S. contracted with an Italian shipbuilder and agreed to make payment in four yearly installments in euros as a ship is being built.  What type of market risk is present, and why?

*Feedback*

This scenario is an example of exchange rate risk. The buyer bears risk that the dollar may depreciate in value in relation to the euro. If that happens, it will require more dollars to make the stipulated payment in euros.

**Credit Risk**

Credit risk relates to the uncertainty about a party that is obligated to pay money per a binding agreement. Will the party actually pay all the money owed and on time? For instance, the party could be a customer who bought the organization's products or services on credit. If every customer paid the amount owed on time, there would be no credit risk. However, if a customer defaults on the credit agreement, the income from the sale is at risk. 

Similarly, if the obligated party secured a loan from the organization and then defaulted on the loan agreement, the principal and interest are both at risk. For example, if an organization discovers that a $50,000 loan is in default and uncollectible due to the deteriorated financial condition of the obligated party, the organization will have to adjust its balance sheet. The asset account for loans made by the organization will have to be reduced by $50,000 and, to maintain balance, the net worth account will also be reduced by the same amount.

**Price Risk**

Price risk relates to the uncertainty of accurately setting the price of an organization's product. Input or output price risk can lead to loss of revenue. 

Input price risk is the uncertainty of the price of the resources used to produce an organization's product. An increase in the price of a resource, such as copper for a wire manufacturer, will lower the manufacturer's margin on wire unless it raises the price of the wire.

Output price risk is the uncertainty regarding the price an organization can charge for its product. A competitor's pricing may force an organization to lower the price for its product to one with a very thin margin for profit. For example, a baker might have to lower the price of their baked goods to compete with other bakers in the area.

**Check Your Understanding**

Cirrostratus Insurance is trying to determine what premium rate to charge for liability insurance in a competitive market. What financial risk does Cirrostratus face, and what makes setting the premium particularly difficult for an insurer?

*Feedback*

Cirrostratus is exposed to price risk because competitors may underprice the product to gain market share. A unique challenge for insurers such as Cirrostratus is that they don't know the costs of the product (input price risk) until after all the claims have been closed on the policies sold.

**Summary**

Operational risks originate from the four general categories of people, process, systems, and external events. Financial risk refers to the uncertainty about the future investment returns of a given asset and can be classified as market risk, credit risk, or price risk.

**Glossary**

Market risk: Uncertainty about an investment's future value because of potential changes in the market for that type of investment.

Interest rate risk: The risk that a security's future value will decline because of changes in interest rates.

Exchange rate risk: Uncertainty about an investment's value because of potential changes in the exchange rate between currencies.

Liquidity risk: The risk that an asset cannot be sold on short notice without incurring a loss.

Credit risk: The risk that customers or other creditors will fail to make promised payments as they come due.

Price risk: The potential for a change in revenue or cost because of an increase or a decrease in the price of a product or an input."

**Objective**

Summarize the products insurers offer for managing personal property and liability risks.

Individuals and families have a variety of personal risk management needs related to their property and liability loss exposures. Risk is involved in owning just about everything: house, car, motor home, watercraft, all-terrain vehicle (ATV), golf cart, or dog.

Homeowners insurance addresses many of these needs and can help ensure the financial security and well-being of policyholders. But homeowners insurance forms differ based on the types of property eligible for coverage and types of coverage provided.

Similarly, auto insurance provides coverage for the loss exposures of those who own and operate automobiles and a means to compensate those who are injured or incur property damage resulting from auto accidents for which they aren't at fault.

For watercraft and other sources of personal liability loss exposures, specialized policies or endorsements to homeowners and personal auto policies can enhance an insured's protection.

**Homeowners Coverages**

Loss exposures and, as a result, coverage needs can vary greatly from homeowner to homeowner, and from renter to renter. Fortunately, several homeowners forms are available to meet all sorts of homeowner and renter needs in the personal lines market.

**What Do You Know?**

Professionals dealing with homeowners policies need to know the difference between named perils coverage and open perils coverage. Can you explain the difference?

*Feedback*: Insurance policies that offer named perils (or broad form) coverage list the causes of loss for which coverage is provided. Policies that offer open perils (or special form) coverage insure against all causes of loss except those specifically excluded or limited by the policy. So open perils coverage is typically more comprehensive.

Although homeowners forms can vary slightly, they generally provide the same types of coverages, just to differing degrees. The most prominent forms are those in the Insurance Services Office, Inc. (ISO) Homeowners (HO) insurance program.

**Breaking Down Prominent Homeowners Policy Forms**

[b]Breaking Down Prominent Homeowners Policy Forms.[/b]

The HO-2–Broad Form covers owner-occupants of dwellings and provides coverage for the dwelling and personal property on a named-perils basis for causes of loss such as those shown here. It also provides liability coverages.

The HO-3–Special Form provides coverage for owner-occupants of dwellings. It insures the dwelling and other structures on an open-perils basis and personal property on a named-perils basis. It also covers liability.

The HO-4–Contents Broad Form is designed for tenants and other occupants of dwellings or apartments and protects their personal property on a named-perils basis. For example, a washer/dryer set is covered under personal property. It also covers liability.

The HO-5–Comprehensive Form is designed for owner-occupants of dwellings and provides the broadest of coverages, such as an open-perils coverage on the dwelling, other structures, and personal property. In addition to liability coverages, there is also loss of use coverage.

The HO-6–Unit Owners Form is designed for owners of residential condominium units and provides limited dwelling coverage and personal property coverage on a named-perils basis. It also provides liability and loss of use coverage.

The HO-8–Modified Coverage Form provides limited named-perils coverage for owner-occupants of dwellings and other structures. Coverage is provided for the dwelling, personal property, and liability loss exposures.

The HO-14–Contents Comprehensive Form is designed to provide broader coverage for renters' personal property than the HO-4. For example, it covers property on an open-perils basis, provides coverage on a replacement-cost basis instead of the HO-4's actual cash value basis, and provides coverage for home-sharing exposures.

Many endorsements are available to modify HO policies to best meet the needs of individuals and families. Endorsements can increase or decrease limits, add or remove coverages, change definitions, clarify policy intent, and recognize specific characteristics that require a premium increase or decrease.

**Check Your Understanding**

Samuel and Gabriela own a home that's insured under an HO-3 policy. They recently upgraded a lot of furniture and now wish to purchase broader coverage for the house and its contents. Which of the ISO HO forms discussed here would be most appropriate for them—and why?

*Feedback*: The HO-5–Comprehensive Form would be the most appropriate form for Samuel and Gabriela. It provides open perils coverage on dwellings, other structures, and personal property (such as furniture) and is designed to meet the risk management needs of owner-occupants of dwellings who would like the broadest coverage available among ISO's forms. In contrast, the HO-3–Special Form provides coverage for personal property on a more limited named perils basis.

**Personal Vehicle Coverages**

In the United States, people who are injured or have property damaged in auto accidents for which they are not at fault are entitled to compensation. The tort liability system, which is based on fault, is the traditional and most commonly used method of seeking compensation for injured auto accident victims. Under this system, victims must prove that another party was at fault before they can collect damages from that party.

To ensure that at-fault drivers have a means to compensate auto accident victims, most states have enacted compulsory auto insurance laws. These laws require motorists to obtain auto liability insurance before they can drive legally within the state, usually in the form of a personal auto policy (PAP).

**The Six Sections of the PAP Explained**

[b]The Six Sections of the Personal Auto Policy Explained.[/b]

Six separate sections of the Personal Auto Policy explain its coverage and provisions.

Part A is for liability coverage. It protects insureds against bodily injury or damage claims for which they're at fault.

Part B is medical payments coverage, which covers medical and funeral expenses when the insured is injured or dies in an auto accident.

Uninsured motorists coverage (or UM) compensates insureds who are injured in hit-and-run accidents or by motorists who are uninsured.

Part D pays for damage to an auto caused by a collision, or perils other than collision that can damage an auto. These are often referred to as collision and comprehensive, or comp, coverages.

Part E outlines the insured's duties, such as notifying the insurer, after an accident or loss.

Part F explains things such as how a policy can be modified or terminated. It also describes the policy period and coverage territory.

While most states are at-fault states, some are no-fault states. No-fault laws authorize or mandate the use of personal injury protection (PIP) coverage and define the benefits that insurers can or must provide in those states. They tend to remove small bodily injury claims from the court system.

No-fault states have enacted no-fault laws to differing degrees, resulting in three types of no-fault plans:

**Modified no-fault plans**

These place some restrictions on the right to sue an at-fault driver but do not entirely eliminate this right. Under a modified no-fault plan, injured motorists collect economic losses from their own insurers through the PIP benefits mandated by the plan. They can then sue at-fault drivers for any economic losses that exceed the no-fault coverage limits and for noneconomic losses if their injuries exceed a threshold stated in the law.

**Add-on plans**

These add no-fault benefits to auto insurance policies but place no restrictions on the injured person's right to sue a negligent party for damages.

**Choice no-fault plans**

Under these plans, insureds can choose whether to be covered on a modified no-fault basis. In most states with choice no-fault plans, insureds who choose not to be covered on a modified no-fault basis must purchase add-on no-fault coverages.

**Check Your Understanding**

William lives in a modified no-fault state and carries the minimum PIP medical coverage limit of $20,000 set by the plan. His state has a monetary threshold of $50,000 for noneconomic losses. William sustains injuries in an auto accident and incurs $30,000 in economic losses. He also suffers $15,000 in noneconomic losses. Can William seek payment for his economic and noneconomic damages from his insurer and/or the at-fault party—and, if so, for how much?

*Feedback*: William can collect $20,000 in economic losses from his insurer through his PIP. He can then sue the at-fault party for the remaining $10,000 in economic losses, but he must prove that the other driver was at fault. Under modified no-fault laws, insureds cannot collect for noneconomic losses through their PIP coverage, so William cannot collect noneconomic losses from his insurer. Additionally, because William's noneconomic losses ($15,000) are below the $50,000 monetary threshold in the state, he can't sue the at-fault party for his noneconomic losses.

Personal auto insurance is also available to protect car owners from theft and other forms of loss or damage that may not necessarily be the fault of others (such as a tree falling on a car while it's parked).

**Other Personal Lines Coverages**

A wide variety of vehicles present an equally wide variety of loss exposures that require effective risk management techniques. Let's examine the insurance options available to manage financial risks associated with different types of recreational vehicles.

**Other Available Personal Lines Coverages**

[b]Other Available Personal Lines Coverages.[/b]

Non-auto vehicles can create a wide variety of loss exposures. Some, such as golf carts or children's motorized play vehicles, may be covered by homeowners policies. Others, such as motor homes or RVs, may be eligible for coverage through an endorsement to a homeowners or personal auto policy.

Although mobile homes, after they are placed on a permanent foundation, can be a lot like traditional homes, they present different property loss exposures. Mobile home policies are designed to meet these unique needs. Alternatively, a mobile home endorsement can modify homeowners policies to provide the necessary coverages, with further endorsements customizing coverage even more.

Because of the potential for significant losses from injuries and property damage resulting from a boating accident, insurance is an important risk management technique used to transfer the financial risk of owning watercraft. Policy availability will depend on the size of the watercraft. Some protection may be provided by a homeowners or personal auto policy.

Lawsuits arising from personal liability exposures can result in settlements that exceed the liability limits of an insured's homeowners, personal auto, and watercraft policies. Personal umbrella policies protect insureds from this possibility. The amount of personal umbrella coverage purchased typically ranges from $1 [million] to $10 million.

It covers the named insured, resident relatives, and people using (with the insured's permission) cars, motorcycles, recreational vehicles, or watercraft owned by or rented to the named insured. People younger than 21 who are in the care of the named insured or of a resident relative are generally also covered.

**Summary**

Homeowners insurance can help ensure the financial security and well-being of policyholders. Similarly, auto insurance provides coverage for the loss exposures of those who operate automobiles and a means of compensating those who are injured or incur property damage resulting from auto accidents for which they aren't at fault. For other sources of personal loss exposures, specialized policies or endorsements can enhance an insured's protection.

[color=blue]
[url=https://learning.theinstitutes.org/mod/scorm/player.php?a=41881&currentorg=TOC1&scoid=83816]How Businesses Integrate Insurance and Risk Management[/url][/color]

**Objective**

Explain how insurance products are complimentary to other risk management strategies.

Bad things happen in business. Mistakes are made. Products fail. Accidents occur. People get injured. Natural disasters strike.

Even with the best risk management strategies, events like these can't be completely avoided. And when they occur, organizations are often left footing the bill. The question is: Can they afford to pay it without proper insurance? And even if they technically can afford it, what will the potentially massive financial losses do to their ability to remain competitive?

The catastrophic potential of mistakes, accidents, and disasters makes insurance a vital part of any organization's holistic risk management program.

Without insurance, many of the risks that can't be completely controlled or eliminated also couldn't be financed in ways that would allow a business to remain viable.

**What Do You Know?**

Is insurance better suited for financing high-severity, low-frequency losses or low-severity, high- frequency losses?

Feedback: Insurance is often the best technique for financing losses with high severity and low frequency. Because insurance shields organizations from the financial consequences of losses they'd have difficulty paying for on their own, it's a key component of most comprehensive risk management programs.

A large corporation's self-insurance plan, for example, might consist of a $1 million retention per occurrence for low-frequency losses, with insurance covering the part of any such loss that exceeds the retention, up to the applicable limit of insurance. Another organization might be comfortable retaining up to $100,000 per occurrence by way of large deductibles on its insurance policies.

Let's examine insurance as a risk management technique, the risks that are generally insurable, and the ability of insurance to meet common risk financing goals.

**Insurance as a Risk Management Technique**

Insurance enables an organization to transfer some of the potential financial consequences of its loss exposures to an insurer through a legal contract (the insurance policy). The insurer agrees to pay for all losses that are covered by the policy, subject to any deductibles and limits of insurance. The insurer also agrees to pay for certain valuable services, such as investigating claims and defending the insured against liability claims. In exchange, the organization pays a premium to the insurer that's ordinarily much smaller than the policy limit(s).

In addition to being a transfer technique, insurance involves sharing the cost of losses. The insurer pools premiums paid by its insureds and pays insureds who experience covered losses from the pooled funds. In this way, all the insureds whose premiums were pooled share the total cost of losses.

Most insurance policies can be characterized as guaranteed cost insurance, in which the premium is specified when the policy takes effect. The cost of the insurance is guaranteed in that the insurer doesn't modify the premium at the end of the policy period based on the insured's loss experience during the policy period.

**The Importance of Insurance for Managing Organizational Risks**

[b]A business's insurance program is a critical component of its overall holistic risk management program.[/b]

Picture this: You're the chief risk officer of an organization with a robust and comprehensive risk management program. You've involved stakeholders from across the organization to identify and analyze all the risks and implement solutions for risk control and financing. You may think you've thought of everything, but you don't have insurance.

The very definition of risk is uncertainty arising from the possible occurrence of given events. Unexpected and devastating losses happen all the time, no matter how well you've prepared. If your risk financing plan doesn't include insurance, a catastrophic loss could financially cripple your organization and bring it to ruins.

So, it's important for a business to use a mix of both risk retention and transfer, integrating insurance into its holistic risk management program to ensure the sustainability and vitality of the organization.

**Insurable Risks and Loss Exposures**

A significant limitation of insurance as a risk financing technique is that it's not available for some types of risks. Insurable risks are mainly confined to hazard risk and operational risk, while financial risk and strategic risk are usually uninsurable.

In general, insurers are willing to insure a loss exposure that has all or most of these characteristics:

- It's associated with pure risk
- It's accidental from the insured's standpoint
- It's definite and measurable
- It's one of a large number of similar exposure units
- It's not catastrophic for the insurer
- It's economically feasible to insure

**Ability to Meet Risk Financing Goals**

Before using insurance for risk financing, an organization should consider the extent to which the insurance meets the organization's risk financing goals.

Insurance is effective in paying for losses, maintaining liquidity, managing uncertainty, and complying with legal and regulatory requirements. It can be less effective than retaining the risk in minimizing the cost of risk, which helps to explain why retention, along with insurance, is a key component of most risk financing plans. An additional benefit of insurance is that an organization can generally deduct insurance premiums for income tax purposes.

**Check Your Understanding**

A risk manager is trying to determine the best risk financing measure for treating market risk to her employer's investment portfolio. Why will the risk manager probably need to look beyond insurance to find a suitable measure for treating market risk?

Feedback: Market risk is a type of speculative risk and, as such, is generally not insurable. Most insurable loss exposures are associated with pure risk—the possibility of loss or no loss. Speculative risk, in contrast, entails the additional possibility of gain.

**Summary**

Insurance is a key component of most holistic risk management, as it helps shield organizations from the potential catastrophic financial consequences associated with their risks. In general, insurers are willing to insure loss exposures with all or most of these characteristics: associated with pure risk, accidental from the insured's standpoint, definite and measurable, one of a large number of similar exposure units, not catastrophic for the insurer, and economically feasible to insure. Before using insurance, an organization should consider the extent to which insurance meets its risk financing goals.

**Objective**

Illustrate examples of products insurers market for managing commercial property risks.

Organizations have a variety of loss exposures related to the property they own, use, make, or sell. Because of this, insurers sell a variety of products intended to manage commercial property risks. 

Midsize and large businesses often use the commercial property coverage part of the commercial package policy, or CPP, to insure their business and personal property. The Insurance Services Office, Inc. (ISO) commercial property coverage part allows flexibility for organizations to build the appropriate coverage package to meet their needs.

**Components of a Commercial Property Coverage Part**

[Image of components of a commercial property coverage part]

**The Building and Personal Property Coverage Form**

The ISO Building and Personal Property Coverage Form (BPP) can cover any combination of three broad categories of property: Building, Your Business Personal Property, and Personal Property of Others.

The BPP's main insuring agreement states that the insurer will pay for direct physical damage to covered property at the described premises resulting from a covered cause of loss. So before any claim for property loss can be paid, the damaged property must qualify as covered property.

**What Do You Know?**

Let's say a business owns an office building and insures it under a BPP that covers only the building as defined in the policy. Would equipment that the business owns and uses to clean and maintain the building be considered covered property under its BPP?

Feedback: Yes, the equipment would be covered property under the BPP because the definition of building includes personal property owned by the insured and used to maintain or service the building or its premises.

Let's take a look at the BPP's three categories of covered property.

**Building**

The BPP's definition of ""building"" includes these elements:

- Completed additions to covered buildings
- Fixtures (including outdoor fixtures)
- Permanently installed machinery and equipment
- Personal property owned by the insured and used to maintain or service the building or its premises (for example, fire-extinguishing equipment; outdoor furniture; floor coverings; and equipment for refrigeration, ventilation, cooking, dishwashing, or laundering)

The building definition also covers additions, alterations, or repairs in progress (including materials, equipment, and supplies used in connection with such work) that are not otherwise insured. However, these materials, equipment, and supplies must be located within 100 feet of the described premises to be covered.

**Your Business Personal Property**

Your Business Personal Property covers personal property owned by insureds for use in their business. One of these conditions must be met for this coverage to apply:

- The property must be located in or on the described building.
- The property must be located in the open (or in a vehicle) within 100 feet of either the building or structure or of the described premises, whichever distance is greater.

The exception to these requirements is an extension that provides limited coverage for property while away from the insured premises.

Your Business Personal Property includes furniture, fixtures, machinery, equipment, stock, and all other personal property owned by the insured and used in the insured's business unless it is excluded under the Property Not Covered section. Your Business Personal Property also includes labor, materials, or services furnished by the insured on personal property of others.

Leased personal property for which the named insured has a contractual responsibility to provide insurance is also included under Your Business Personal Property, as are the insured's interest in improvements or betterments. 

**Personal Property of Others**

Some businesses, such as laundries, dry cleaners, or computer repair shops, take temporary possession of customers' property to perform the services they offer. The Personal Property of Others coverage protects the insured against loss of or damage to such property under these conditions:

- While the property is in the insured's care, custody, or control
- While the property is in or on the building described in the declarations or within 100 feet of either the building or structure or of the described premises, whichever distance is greater

Coverage applies regardless of whether the insured is legally responsible for the damage.

**Equipment Breakdown Coverage**

The BPP covers damage to equipment, but only for the perils insured against in the BPP's causes of loss forms. This means additional coverage is needed for perils such as mechanical and electrical breakdown and steam explosion.

Equipment breakdown insurance, also known as boiler and machinery insurance, covers loss resulting from the accidental breakdown of covered equipment. The covered equipment can be almost any type of equipment that operates under pressure or that controls, transmits, transforms, or uses mechanical or electrical power.

Because equipment breakdown insurance is a small, specialized field, many insurers include equipment breakdown coverage in their commercial package policies and then reinsure the equipment breakdown coverage with an insurer that specializes in that line. The specialized insurer assumes the financial consequences of the loss exposure and provides underwriting, risk control, and claims services.

**Business Income and Extra Expense Coverage**

Insurance for most business income exposures is available under these two ISO coverage forms:

- The Business Income (and Extra Expense) Coverage Form—This covers both business income and extra expense losses (even if the extra expenses do not reduce the business income loss).
- The Business Income (Without Extra Expense) Coverage Form—This covers business income loss but covers extra expenses only to the extent that they reduce the business income loss.

Either form can be included in a commercial property coverage part, with or without another commercial property coverage form, such as the Building and Personal Property Coverage Form. 

**Calculating a Business Income Loss**

In addition to compensating insureds for damage to covered property, profit is something insurers want to help insureds preserve after a loss. For example, let's say Locksey Hardware Store was damaged in a fire. While it was being repaired, the store was closed for three months. Here are the store's expected revenue, expenses, and profit if the fire hadn't happened and it remained open during those three months.

Since it was closed, its revenue was reduced to zero. However, due to the closure, some of its ordinary expenses, such as payroll and utilities, were temporarily reduced. But the store incurred additional expenses to reopen, such as paying for express shipping to restock the store.

For insurance purposes, Locksey's business income loss is $180,000, which is calculated by combining the $60,000 in profit it expected but did not earn because of the fire and the $120,000 in expenses it incurred during the closure.

**Inland Marine Insurance**

Inland marine insurance provides flexible solutions that cover many loss exposures other commercial forms don't—primarily those that involve some element of transportation.

The Business and Personal Property Coverage Form covers property on or within 100 feet of the insured premises. However, commercial inland marine policies can cover property in transit, property kept at other locations, and so-called floating property, such as contractors' equipment, which moves from job site to job site. These policies may have territorial limits (for example, the United States and Canada).

These coverages are available for property in transit:

- An annual transit policy covers all shipments made or received by the insured throughout a one-year policy period.
- A trip transit policy covers cargo on a specified trip, such as machinery being moved from a manufacturer to a business.
- A motor truck cargo liability policy covers a trucker's liability for damage to cargo of others being transported by the trucker.

**Other Inland Marine Coverages**

Let's take a look at some other inland marine coverages.

A contractors equipment floater insures contractors equipment while it's anywhere within the coverage territory, such as at job sites and between locations.

A builders risk policy covers a building during the course of construction, including the building supplies and material.

A bailees' customer policy covers damage to customers' goods while in the possession of the insured, regardless of whether the insured is legally liable for the damage.

A dealers policy covers the inventory and property of dealers that qualify for inland marine coverage, such as jewelers, equipment dealers, and fine arts dealers.

And inland marine policies can also cover instrumentalities of transportation and communication, such as bridges and telephone lines.

**Commercial Crime Coverage**

Many types of insurance provide coverage against some property losses that result from criminal acts. Because policyholders' crime loss exposures vary significantly and require special underwriting skills, insurers prefer to cover certain types of crime-related property loss under separate commercial crime insurance forms.

Briefly described, commercial crime insurance covers money, securities, and other property against a variety of criminal acts, such as employee theft, robbery, forgery, extortion, and computer fraud. Financial institution bonds are used to meet the crime insurance needs of financial entities, such as banks and insurance companies.

**What Do You Know?**

Can you think of other types of criminal acts that can be covered by commercial crime insurance, in addition to those just listed?

Feedback: Some possible answers are computer and funds transfer fraud, extortion, malicious destruction of electronic data or computer programs, fraudulent impersonation, and good-faith acceptance of counterfeit money.

Three basic coverage combinations are available for crime loss exposures: commercial crime, which provides crime coverage to organizations other than financial institutions and government entities; government crime, which provides crime coverage for government entities; and employee theft and forgery, which provides only employee theft and forgery or alteration coverage.

The commercial crime and government crime coverages are available either in a coverage form that can be added to a package policy or as a stand-alone monoline policy.

**Summary**

The commercial property lines market provides a variety of coverages to meet the unique loss exposures of different businesses. Some commercial property lines, such as equipment breakdown, are specialized and more typically reinsured.

**Glossary**

Building and Personal Property Coverage Form (BPP): A commercial property coverage form that can be used to cover buildings, ""your business personal property,"" and personal property of others.

Business income: Sum of (1) net profit or loss that would have been earned or incurred if the suspension had not occurred and (2) normal operating expenses, including payroll, that continue during the suspension.

**Objective**

Give examples of products insurers market for managing commercial liability risks.

Commercial liability risks may be no more difficult to identify than other risks, but they can provide more of a challenge when it comes to quantification. 

For this reason, insurers provide policies that cover liability risks faced by most businesses. Four major types are commercial general liability, commercial auto liability, workers compensation liability, and employers liability.

**Commercial General Liability**

Commercial general liability insurance encompasses three main coverages: bodily injury and property damage liability, personal and advertising injury liability, and medical payments.

**Commercial General Liability Coverages**

Commercial general liability insurance generally provides three coverages: bodily injury and property damage liability, personal and advertising injury liability, and medical payments.

In providing bodily injury and property damage liability coverage, the insurer agrees to pay damages the insured becomes legally obligated to pay because of covered bodily injury or property damage claims. In addition, the insurer will defend the insured against claims or lawsuits involving these types of losses.

Personal and advertising injury liability coverage will pay damages the insured becomes legally obligated to pay because of personal and advertising injury claims covered by the policy. These injuries include libel, which is defamatory written statements; slander, which is defamatory verbal statements; false arrest; and using another person's advertising idea.

Medical payments coverage provides a modest limit to settle minor bodily injury cases without requiring a determination of liability, thereby effecting prompt settlements, satisfying potential liability claimants, and avoiding possible larger liability claims.

**Commercial Auto Liability**

Commercial auto insurance can be used to cover liability loss exposures, property loss exposures, and personal loss exposures arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of autos. A common format for insuring these loss exposures is the Insurance Services Office, Inc. (ISO) commercial auto coverage part. A commercial auto coverage part can be included in a commercial package policy (CPP) or issued as a monoline policy.

**Workers Compensation Liability**

Workers compensation liability insurance covers an employer's obligation to pay benefits required by workers compensation statutes. Generally, payments are limited only by what is required by the applicable workers compensation law—the policies themselves do not show a dollar limit. The insurer has a duty to defend the insured against claims, proceedings, or suits seeking benefits payable by the policy. The insurer also agrees to pay additional costs, such as for investigating a claim and handling litigation costs.

However, under this coverage, the insured is required to reimburse the insurer for any penalties applied under a workers compensation law due to the employer's willful misconduct, knowing employment of anyone illegally, failure to comply with health and safety laws and regulations, or discrimination against employees who claim workers compensation benefits.

Additionally, when the insurer pays workers compensation benefits (or damages under employers liability coverage) on behalf of an insured, any right of recovery the insured or the injured employee may have against a third party is transferred to the insurer.

**Employers Liability Insurance**

Employers liability insurance covers an employer against liability for an employee's occupational injury or disease that is not covered by a workers compensation statute.

**Let's Hear From an Expert: Clive O'Connell**

Laws that protect employees give those employees rights, and with rights come corresponding liabilities. If the employee becomes entitled to something, the employer is obliged to provide it and is liable for its provision. This is the way that employee rights are protected around the world.

Enforcement of rights can take different forms. Some rights are enforceable by the employee. They have a right, and if the employer doesn't provide it or doesn't provide what they're entitled to, then the employee can sue. Other rights are enforced by a regulator.

If an employee, for example, is given the right to a safe place to work and safety isn't provided, then the regulator will take enforcement action and may fine and may force the employer to provide those rights. There's a liability to do that.

That said, regulatory enforcement does not necessarily--in fact, generally doesn't--preclude the employee from also suing for a breach of those rights.

Under employers liability coverage, the insurer agrees to pay damages the insured becomes legally obligated to pay because of bodily injury to an employee. Examples of the types of claims that would be covered include:

- Third-party claim (also known as a third-party-over action)—An employee of the insured sues a third party (such as the manufacturer of equipment used by another company to make tools) for an occupational injury, and the third party then sues the employer. The third party's suit might allege, for example, that the employer was negligent in maintaining a defective machine and that the employer must therefore indemnify the manufacturer for all damages the manufacturer had to pay to the employee.

- Claim for care and loss of services (also known as loss of consortium)—The spouse or another family member of an injured employee sues the employer for loss of companionship or services (such as housekeeping or yard work that the employee would otherwise have performed) resulting from the injury. Many states restrict or prohibit such suits.

- Dual-capacity claim—An employee who has sustained bodily injury arising out of and in the course of employment sues the employer in a capacity other than as employer. For example, an employee in a state that has accepted the dual-capacity doctrine is injured at work by a product manufactured by the employer. The employee sues the employer in its capacity as a manufacturer.

**Check Your Understanding**

Paradox Contractors is installing kitchen cabinets, which it manufactured, in a customer's home. One of the cabinets fell on and injured the customer. Assuming Paradox had commercial general liability coverage, which one of the three types of coverage might apply?

*Feedback*

Because the claim involves an injury to the customer that occurred while Paradox was doing the work, it would be covered under Paradox's bodily injury and property damage liability coverage.

**Summary**

Available policies can provide coverage for liability risks faced by most businesses. Four of them are commercial general liability, commercial auto liability, workers compensation liability, and employers liability.

**Glossary**

Personal loss exposure: Any condition or situation that presents the possibility of a financial loss to an individual or a family by such causes as death, sickness, injury, or unemployment.

Commercial package policy (CPP): Policy that covers two or more lines of business by combining ISO's commercial lines coverage parts.

Monoline policy: Policy that covers only one line of business.

Third-party-over action: A separate legal action, brought by a defendant in a lawsuit, against a third party that might be liable to the defendant for all or part of the plaintiff's claim in the original lawsuit.

Loss of consortium: The loss of benefits that one spouse is entitled to receive from the other, including companionship, affection, and sexual relations resulting from the injury or death of a spouse.

Dual-capacity doctrine: A legal doctrine giving the employee the right to sue the employer when the employer acts in a capacity other than that of employer."

**Objective**

Respond to an insurance inquiry using common policy terminology.

The insurance industry primarily provides a service: protection from financial harm. This protection is the core product of the insurance value chain.

Insurance, however, is often intangible from an insured's perspective—at least until a loss occurs—so insurance professionals who understand and can explain how coverage works are better situated to build strong customer relationships, communicate effectively with internal stakeholders, and establish short- and long-term strategies to maximize the insurance value chain.

**Adding Value When Responding to an Insurance Inquiry**

[b]Adding Value When Responding to an Insurance Inquiry[/b]

Sofia has inherited her parents' home and decided to make it her primary residence. She contacted the insurer that provided her parents with their homeowners coverage and requested a standard homeowners policy, assuming that was what her parents used to cover the house.

Sofia knows that her parents dealt with multiple sewer backups while living there, which were covered by their homeowners policy. But what she didn't know was that their policy had a Sewer Backup Endorsement attached to it; an unendorsed policy excludes sewer backup.

The producer pointed this out to Sofia, and she elected to add the endorsement. Had the producer overlooked this coverage gap, the insurer may have been able to successfully deny a claim for sewer backup damages, but it would likely face customer dissatisfaction, reputational harm, or even litigation if Sofia thought she'd have coverage for a claim that was ultimately denied.

With this in mind, let's examine some of the major concepts that underlie insurance coverage.

**Insurable Interest**

The concept of insurable interest is one of the foundations of the insurance transaction. A party has an insurable interest if they could suffer a financial loss if the insured property is damaged or a covered liability claim is filed; the party must have an insurable interest in the subject of an insurance policy to obtain coverage. 

Multiple parties can have an insurable interest in the subject of insurance. For example, a homeowner and a mortgage company both have an insurable interest in a financed home because they both have a financial stake in the property. As a result, the mortgage company may be listed on the homeowners policy as a loss payee along with the homeowner. That way, when a loss occurs, both parties will be covered for their financial stake in the property. 

Insurance is a method of transferring financial risk from one party to another. It's not meant to be a source of profit for insureds, but a means to recover losses. Without an insurable interest in a building, for example, an insured may have little motivation to maintain the property or take other measures to prevent loss—and could even be motivated to intentionally cause a loss and then file a claim in an attempt to profit from the policy. This is why insurable interest is necessary to obtain coverage.

**Pricing Coverage**

Insureds want to know why coverage costs what it does, especially if their rates increase or are higher than expected. The process of setting the premium for different coverages involves ratemaking, which considers various kinds of risk-related underwriting data and other factors to determine an appropriate base rate for a particular coverage. The premium that a particular insured is charged may then increase or decrease, depending on whether the insured presents a greater or lesser risk than average. 

Through accurate and appropriate ratemaking, insurers charge insureds an amount that is sufficient to create a pool of collected premiums large enough to pay for the expected covered losses in a policy period.

**Coinsurance**

An important component of policy pricing is coinsurance. This provision requires an insured to carry a certain amount of coverage relative to the insurable value of the insured property, often 80 percent. Coinsurance helps ensure that insureds carry sufficient coverage to repair or replace property in case of a major loss. An insured who does not meet the coinsurance provision may receive proportionately reduced claim payments for any covered loss.

**Property Valuation**

The most common valuation methods insurers use to determine insurable value are replacement cost and actual cash value (ACV). Often, insurers use both methods in the same policy—for example, a homeowners policy may pay the replacement cost of the dwelling and other structures while covering personal property on an ACV basis (unless the insured purchased blanket insurance). In certain situations, however, other valuation measures are used, such as the agreed value method.

**Applying the BPP Coinsurance Provision**

[b]Applying the BPP Coinsurance Provision[/b]

Nanami operates a restaurant out of a building she owns. The building and the business personal property inside it each have an insurable value of $2.5 million. The business personal property is covered for $2 million, but Nanami selected a limit of only $1 million for the building.

Nanami's Building and Personal Property Coverage Form has an 80 percent coinsurance provision. This means that Nanami's building is underinsured. The building's limit ought to be $2 million, calculated by multiplying the insurable value of $2.5 million by the coinsurance requirement of 80 percent, or 0.8. The building personal property limit, on the other hand, does meet the coinsurance requirement.

One day, a fire starts in the restaurant's kitchen and damages both the building and the business personal property inside it. Nanami carried only half the required amount of insurance on the building. Her claim payment for the building loss is reduced by half under the coinsurance provision. The loss to the business personal property is covered in full, up to the $2 million limit.

Now, imagine that instead of insuring her building and business personal property for separate amounts, Nanami purchased blanket insurance, thus covering both types of property under a single limit. In that case, the coinsurance provision would apply to the total of all covered property, not separately to each type of property.

**Deductibles**

Insurers impose deductibles on claim payments to help keep premiums down, reduce the administrative expense of handling many low-value claims, and incentivize insureds to prevent losses from occurring in the first place. On an auto policy, for example, an insured may be responsible for paying the first $500 of a covered $2,000 loss, while the insurer would pay the remaining $1,500.

**Apply Your Knowledge**

What would you say to insureds who don't understand why they would have to pay a deductible after they already paid a premium?

*Feedback*

You could explain that such confusion is understandable, but insurers impose deductibles to reduce the insureds' premiums and encourage insureds to take loss prevention measures.

**The Insurer's Rights Under a Policy**

Insurance policies contain descriptions of each party's rights, including the insurer. When handling claims and communicating with insureds, it's critical that insurance professionals avoid actions that may prohibit the insurer from exercising its rights under the policy.

Insurance professionals therefore need to know what actions can trigger a waiver of those rights or result in an insurer being estopped from asserting its rights.

A waiver can occur under various circumstances. For example, if a claims representative makes an unconditional offer to pay a claim after becoming aware of a coverage defense or a basis for denying liability, the insurer's right to deny the claim is waived. What constitutes a waiver varies by state, so insurance professionals need to understand local regulations.

For estoppel to occur, the insured must suffer harm from relying on the insurer's conduct. These are some examples of circumstances that can result in estoppel:

- Incurring additional expenses: When a claims representative tells an insured to repair a structure or to replace or repair some personal property, causing the insured to incur expenses, the insurer may be estopped (prohibited) from raising a coverage defense or exclusion involving that property.

- Receiving instruction contrary to policy conditions: The insurer will be estopped from claiming a breach of the proof of loss condition when the claims representative has told the insured that the proof of loss doesn't need to be filed until a settlement has been agreed upon.

- Disposing of damaged property: The insurer is estopped from exercising its rights to take all or part of the damaged property as salvage if the insurer has advised the insured to discard or sell the damaged property.

Insurers also have a right to subrogation, which enables them to recover a significant portion of the money they pay out in claims and reduce premiums.

**How Subrogation Works**

[b]How Subrogation Works[/b]

Let's take a look at an example of how subrogation works and why it's important to insurers and their insureds.

Evelyn has a personal auto policy with Greatview Insurance. While she has stopped at a red light, a speeding pickup truck crashes into the rear of her car. The pickup truck driver, Kirk, is arrested for driving while intoxicated.

Evelyn has to seek medical treatment for her neck. She filed a claim with Greatview, which investigated her claim and valued her loss at $18,000. After subtracting her $500 deductible, Greatview issued a claim payment in the amount of $17,500 to Evelyn to cover the physical damage to her car and reimburse her for her medical bills.

Greatview then exercised its subrogation rights against Kirk, who was legally liable for the accident and resulting damage and injuries. Kirk's auto insurer paid the entire $18,000 loss to Greatview. Out of this subrogation recovery, Greatview reimbursed Evelyn for her $500 deductible.

**Summary**

Insurance professionals who understand and can articulate major coverage concepts can maximize the insurance value chain through more effective communication with internal and external stakeholders and stronger customer relationships. 

**Glossary**

Insurable interest: An interest in the subject of an insurance policy that is not unduly remote and that would cause the interested party to suffer financial loss if an insured event occurred.

Ratemaking: The process insurers use to calculate insurance rates, which are a premium component.

Coinsurance: An insurance-to-value provision in many property insurance policies providing that if the property is underinsured, the amount that an insurer will pay for a covered loss is reduced.

Replacement cost: The cost to repair or replace property using new materials of like kind and quality with no deduction for depreciation.

Actual cash value (ACV): The cost to replace property with new property of like kind and quality less depreciation.

Blanket insurance: Provides coverage for one type of property in more than one separately rated building or two or more types of property in one or more separately rated buildings under a single limit.

Agreed value method: A method of valuing property in which the insurer and the insured agree, at the time the policy is written, on the maximum amount that will be paid in the event of a total loss.

Deductible: A portion of a covered loss that is not paid by the insurer.

Waiver: The intentional relinquishment of a known right.

Estoppel: A legal principle that prohibits a party from asserting a claim or right that is inconsistent with that party's past statement or conduct on which another party has detrimentally relied.

Subrogation: The process by which an insurer can, after it has paid a loss under the policy, recover the amount paid from any party (other than the insured) who caused the loss or is otherwise legally liable for the loss.

[color=blue]
[url=https://learning.theinstitutes.org/mod/scorm/player.php?a=41885&currentorg=TOC1&scoid=83824]Noninsurance Contractual Risk Transfer[/url][/color]

**Objective**

Demonstrate common types of noninsurance contractual risk transfer for treating hazard risk.

Most organizations purchase insurance to transfer responsibility for the financial consequences of some of their loss exposures to an insurer. To further assist with risk transfer, organizations also engage in noninsurance contracts, such as leases, construction contracts, and purchase agreements, which can also include risk transfer provisions.

When an organization enters into a contract, it might transfer its loss exposures to the other party or assume the other party's loss exposures. In a noninsurance contractual risk transfer, one party (the transferee), which is not an insurance company, accepts another party's (the transferor's) loss exposures or financial consequences of the transferor's loss exposures as an incidental aspect of another business transaction. These agreements fall into two categories:

**A noninsurance transfer for risk control**

Such an agreement shifts loss exposures to the transferee to reduce the frequency and/or severity of the transferor's losses arising from the loss exposures.

**A noninsurance transfer for risk financing**

Such an agreement transfers only the financial consequences of the transferor's loss exposures.

**What Do You Know?**

A crucial difference between these two categories of agreements becomes apparent when a transferee becomes insolvent or otherwise unable to fulfill contractual transfer terms. Can you think of what it is?

*Feedback*

In a noninsurance transfer for risk financing, an insolvent transferee provides no protection to the transferor, who must then pay for its own losses. In a noninsurance transfer for risk control, a bankrupt or uncooperative transferee may continue to be responsible for losses arising from the transferred loss exposures, preserving the transferor's protection.

**Noninsurance Transfers for Risk Control**

A noninsurance transfer for risk control can take various forms. Four common types of noninsurance transfers for risk control are leases, contracting for services, waivers or exculpatory clauses (exculpatory agreements), and disclaimers of warranties.

**Leases**

Certain losses that can arise from property ownership don't exist for a lessee occupying the property—for example, accidental damage to the property and liability to third parties resulting from hazards on the property. However, two important exceptions apply:

- The lease obligates the lessee to return the property to the lessor in the same condition in which it was received.
- The lessee is at fault in causing harm to others.

An organization that leases property instead of owning it practices risk control by allowing the property owner to retain the risks related to property ownership.

**Contracting for Services**

An individual or organization is generally held primarily responsible for any losses caused by its activities. However, it can transfer this loss exposure by contracting with other organizations to perform each activity.

This noninsurance transfer method is called contracting for services, or simply subcontracting—even though the transferor need not be an independent contractor, and the transferee need not be a subcontractor.

Liability loss exposures associated with an activity are not easily transferred, especially those that involve harm to third parties. For example, if negligence by a property owner's landscaping contractor creates a hazard that injures a visitor on the owner's property, the contractor would be primarily liable. However, the injured visitor could sue the property owner as the party responsible for the property's condition.

Because courts seek to compensate those who are injured, they favor restricting the rule exempting the person who hires an independent contractor (the principal) from liability for the independent contractor's torts. So they have established some exceptions to this rule.

**Exceptions That Keep Liability With the Principal for Contractors' Torts**

The principal is directly liable for negligence in selecting the contractor, giving directions, or failing to stop any unnecessary dangerous practices of which the principal was aware.

The principal's responsibility for performing certain duties safely cannot be delegated to another party. For example, the owner of an apartment building cannot transfer to a contractor its duty to keep common areas safe.

If the subcontracted work is inherently dangerous to others, such as blasting or excavating near a public highway, the principal that hired the contractor can be held liable for a third-party injury caused by the contractor's negligence.

**Waiver or Exculpatory Clauses**

An individual or organization can relinquish its right to sue another party through either a waiver or exculpatory clause (which is similar to a waiver). As a result, both waivers and exculpatory clauses can function as effective risk control mechanisms.

Waivers or exculpatory clauses in various contracts can transfer responsibility for liability loss exposures. For example, in a particular jurisdiction, local law may allow a real property lessee (tenant) to sue a lessor (landlord) for failing to maintain premises suitable for people to live in. However, if the lease agreement between the two contains a provision stating that the lessee waives its right to sue the lessor for this reason, the lessor no longer faces that exposure.

**Disclaimers of Warranties**

Sellers of property often assert disclaimers of warranties. A disclaimer in a sales contract may deny any express warranties made during the property's sale. It may also deny implied warranties, such as the implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose and the implied warranty of merchantability.

This is an example of disclaimer language used in a software sales contract: ""[Seller's property] is provided 'as is.' To the maximum extent permitted by law, [seller] disclaims all warranties of any kind, either express or implied, including, without limitation, implied warranties of fitness for a particular purpose and merchantability.""

**Noninsurance Transfers for Risk Financing**

Noninsurance transfers for risk financing are accomplished through hold-harmless agreements (or indemnity agreements). These are commonly included in various types of contracts and agreements, such as construction contracts, maintenance contracts, rental and lease agreements, purchase orders, and sales agreements.

An example of a hold-harmless agreement is this provision in a lease of premises: ""To the fullest extent permitted by law, the lessee shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the lessor, agents, and employees of the lessor from and against all claims arising out of or resulting from the leased premises.""

The party that uses a hold-harmless agreement to transfer the financial consequences of loss to a second party is commonly referred to as the indemnitee; the second party, which agrees to indemnify the indemnitee, is referred to as the indemnitor.

To increase the likelihood that it will have the necessary financial resources, the indemnitor may need to demonstrate proof of financial responsibility, such as through a certificate of insurance. Commercial general liability insurance policies and commercial auto liability policies commonly include coverage for liability assumed under an insured contract.

Hold-harmless agreements can be classified according to the extent of responsibility they transfer. For example, let's say the contracting parties are Building Owner and General Contractor. They may adopt any one of these three forms:

**Limited form**

General Contractor agrees to indemnify Building Owner only for claims that result from General Contractor's own negligence, often referred to as sole fault.

**Intermediate form**

General Contractor agrees to indemnify Building Owner only for claims that result from General Contractor's sole fault or from both parties' joint fault.

**Broad form**

General Contractor agrees to indemnify Building Owner for losses that result from General Contractor's sole fault, both parties' joint fault, or Building Owner's sole fault.

Many jurisdictions have anti-indemnity statutes that prohibit broad form and/or intermediate form hold-harmless agreements contained in construction contracts. In some jurisdictions that don't have such statutes, judicial rules (established by courts) limit the use of hold-harmless agreements. The purpose of these statutes and rules is to prevent a party with greater bargaining power from taking advantage of the contract's other party, who is often less able to assume the other's liability.

The handling of punitive damages (exemplary damages) under hold-harmless agreements also varies.

For example, in some jurisdictions, the indemnitor is obligated to pay punitive damages only when specified in the agreement. In others, the indemnitor's obligation to pay punitive damages is automatic under hold-harmless agreements. In still others, contractual transfer of the obligation to pay punitive damages is illegal.

Because the statutory prohibitions and judicial rules vary by state, it's essential to determine the legality and provisions of a proposed hold-harmless agreement in the applicable jurisdiction before including it in a contract. To make sure contracts don't contain unacceptable hold-harmless provisions, every organization should carefully review them before signing.

In many cases, the other party, if challenged, will accept a mutual indemnification provision to preserve the transaction. Through this provision, each party agrees to indemnify the other for losses resulting from its own negligence in connection with the contract or agreement.

In some cases, organizations use hold-harmless agreements to finance loss exposures that are not economically feasible to insure. However, in many cases, an organization using a hold-harmless agreement to finance a particular loss exposure also has insurance that includes coverage for that exposure.

For example, a paving contractor hired to resurface a shopping mall's parking lot may agree to an intermediate form hold-harmless agreement in the owner's favor. The owner may also have coverage under its commercial general liability insurance policy for bodily injury and property damage liability claims arising out of the contractor's work.

Before using a hold-harmless agreement as a risk-financing measure, an organization should evaluate its ability to meet common risk-financing goals.

**Check Your Understanding**

A private university has contracted with a landscaping service to maintain all lawns and gardens on its campus. The contract includes a hold-harmless agreement in which the landscaper promises to indemnify the university for claims made against it for bodily injury or property damage resulting only from the landscaper's sole fault or from both parties' joint fault. Evaluate the effectiveness of this hold-harmless agreement for transferring hazard risk from the university to the landscaper.

*Feedback*

A hold-harmless agreement transfers only the financial consequences of certain loss exposures, not the loss exposures themselves, to the indemnitor. In addition, the hold-harmless agreement is effective only to the extent that the landscaper has the financial ability to indemnify the university. The university should therefore require the landscaper to provide a certificate of insurance or other evidence of its ability to pay the transferred loss consequences. Further, the university should use one or more other risk-financing measures to cover claims that are not subject to the hold-harmless agreement, such as claims resulting from the university's sole fault or claims alleging harm other than bodily injury or property damage.

**Summary**

A noninsurance contractual risk transfer can be classified as either a noninsurance transfer for risk control or a noninsurance transfer for risk financing. A noninsurance transfer for risk control shifts loss exposures to the transferee to reduce the frequency and/or severity of the transferor's losses. A noninsurance transfer for risk financing transfers only the financial consequences of loss exposures; if the transferee defaults, the transferor ultimately retains responsibility. Common types of noninsurance transfers for risk control include leases, contracting for services, waiver or exculpatory clauses, and disclaimers of warranties. Noninsurance transfer for risk financing is accomplished through hold-harmless agreements, also known as indemnity agreements.

"Leading With Critical Thinking","CPCU 500","11593","# Thinking Critically

[color=blue]
[url=https://learning.theinstitutes.org/mod/scorm/player.php?a=41886&currentorg=TOC1&scoid=83826]Thinking Critically[/url][/color]

**Objective**

Identify the components of a critical thinking process.

Critical thinking requires people to consider all available information and viewpoints before determining which solution offers the best possible outcome. For example, a marketing manager may consult with the Customer Service and Underwriting departments to craft an informed plan for launching a new product line or marketing campaign. 

With many components of the insurance value chain becoming more reliant on artificial intelligence (AI), a defining characteristic of leadership has become the ability to make informed decisions. In contrast to how AI functions are prisoners of their own processes and surface-level information, critical thinking can reveal underlying factors related to the challenge or scenario's emergence in ways that aren't immediately evident. 

For example, an AI process can determine that it is a bad decision to underwrite a specific policy for a customer at a loss. Critical thinking, however, can take into account additional business that will be provided by the customer and help decide whether underwriting an otherwise unfavorable policy would create more profits elsewhere. Because of the growing complexity of issues faced by insurers—such as the effects of climate change and global economic uncertainty—understanding how to balance data-driven analysis with human insight and perspective creates an advantage in today's marketplace.

**Critical Thinking in Action**

[b]Critical Thinking in Action.[/b]

Although the process of critical thinking doesn't have a rigid order of steps to follow, familiarity with its main components can help guide better decision making. This allows for flexibility in problem solving, providing an opportunity to dig much deeper into the root causes of an issue than traditional problem solving.

For example, suppose Ryan was asked by his boss at Three Hills Insurance to determine whether the company should discontinue support for a specialized commercial lines product that only they offer. To apply critical thinking to this question, Ryan will need to identify the problem or challenge as specifically as possible. Based on what he has been told, Ryan knows the product has not made a profit in several years, as claim payments and administrative costs require more funds than the policy premiums and their subsequent investment create. It may not be worth continuing to offer this product.

To make sure his eventual decision is sound, Ryan gathers as much information as possible regarding the commercial lines product. This includes data on insureds who purchase the product, such as what other products they purchase; how often each files claims; and, if possible, how important the product under consideration for cancellation is to them.

Establishing an initial hypothesis--in this case, that support for the product should be canceled since it no longer earns a profit--will provide a starting point for Ryan to craft an argument supporting his decision. But it can also act as a magnet for challenges or suggestions of alternative courses of action for Ryan to consider.

For example, a co-worker might suggest that some insureds are only customers of Three Hills because of this particular product. Canceling it might endanger any other business those insureds have with the company. Based on these further evaluations, Ryan can alter his own hypotheses in either a minor or major way. He may decide to disregard it entirely in favor of a new hypothesis, which could then also be challenged and researched.

Once Ryan's hypothesis has been refined, he can formulate it into a final conclusion, which he can then present to the decision makers at Three Hills. Because he applied critical thinking to the issue at hand, Ryan can feel confident that his recommendation won't have any unintended consequences that could harm his employer.

Having seen how the stages of the critical thinking process might be put to use, let's take a more general look at each.

**Identify the Question or Challenge as Specifically as Possible**

A question can't be answered unless it is identified. Even if the problem or scenario at the heart of the question seems fairly straightforward, other issues or even an entire network of contributing factors could be less obvious, causing the root problem to resurface within a short time of allegedly being solved.

Identifying the source of the problem or scenario, and then the source of that source, can lead to the instigating issue. At first, this issue might not seem to be related to the original question. But its solution could help with the larger needed fix. Viewing each successive question, challenge, or scenario that is uncovered from different angles will create the best chance of finding a comprehensive solution.

For example, an insurer might believe that dramatically decreased profit margins are a result of failing to adequately rate/price disaster related risks. But further examination could reveal that the actual problem is using outdated catastrophe modeling. So rather than questioning the rates it uses for disaster-related risks, it should instead work to incorporate current data.

**Apply Your Knowledge**

Thinking back to the scenario involving Ryan and Three Hills Insurance, how could Ryan refine the question asking whether Three Hills should discontinue their unprofitable product?

Feedback: Ryan could refine the question by asking why the product isn't profitable: Is it related to inadequate marketing? Is the coverage it provides unnecessary? Is it too expensive? Any of these questions could lead to other, more focused questions, which could improve the end result.

**Gather Information**

To properly answer a question, all available information needs to be collected and reviewed. For example, an insurer that's considering moving out of a geographic market with a high rate of hurricane losses might want information on whether its reputation could be damaged—and, if so, how that could affect its stock price. Neither of those factors seem related to the initial question on the surface, but both could influence the final course of action taken.

**Check Your Understanding**

What are some hazards Ryan may face while collecting information?

Feedback: Ryan must be sure to gather information only from sources that are proven to be accurate and truthful. He should consider whether each source holds an obvious bias, who has authored or collected the information, whether the source has had any credibility issues in the past, and how current the source's information is.

**Develop Initial Hypothesis**

Although it's possible that an initial hypothesis will prove to be the correct answer or course of action in response to a question, more often than not it will act as the starting point for a conversation. Using information gathered on the defined question, the hypothesis should be a best guess of what the most appropriate answer will be. 

If a team, rather than an individual, is crafting the hypothesis, a brainstorming session can be effective. This allows several ideas to be considered and discussed in a relaxed atmosphere, providing an opportunity to examine assumptions and challenge reasoning without judgment. 

In the Three Hills scenario, the initial hypothesis is that the product should be discontinued since it is unprofitable. But what if offering the product provides benefits that could, in other ways, be just as important as profit?

**Challenge Initial Hypothesis**

Challenging the initial hypothesis is where critical thinking truly begins to benefit those who practice it. By refusing to accept the first possible solution, opportunities for improvement and alteration are created. Bringing new participants into the discussion may provide views of the question and possible solutions that hadn't been considered before. Discussion can be spurred by:

- Examining underlying assumptions in the hypothesis and considering how the hypothesis would be affected if those assumptions were incorrect
- Encouraging skepticism toward the information gathered to support the hypothesis and its applicability
- Exploring possible circumstances that might cause the hypothesis to be doubted

In the Three Hills scenario, a Customer Service representative might have relevant insight. For example, the rep could provide perspective on how customers would react to news of the product being discontinued and whether discontinuing it would hurt the company's reputation. 

However, just because a hypothesis has been challenged does not mean it's no longer viable. Challenges provided should be put through the same scrutiny as the hypothesis itself, to make sure they're not based on an oversight or misconception. At the same time, an open mind must be kept if information is found that supports or strengthens those challenges.

**Reformulate Hypotheses**

Even if a hypothesis survives being challenged, potential improvements are likely appropriate. These improvements should be integrated into the initial hypothesis if possible. When a team has reached the point where there are no new ideas to be integrated, then the hypothesis may be ready to become a conclusion.

Just as possible, however, is the scenario that the original hypothesis will need to be set aside completely. In that instance, a new hypothesis will need to be formulated and then run through the challenge process again. 

For example, Ryan may find that, by canceling the product, Three Hills could suffer reputational damage that would outweigh any benefit gained. If so, Ryan may wish to consider simply limiting the product's availability to customers who provide a certain amount of business.

**Develop Conclusion**

Once a hypothesis has been challenged, refined, and improved, it is ready to be formulated into a conclusion. And while this conclusion may be the final stage of the critical thinking process, it should be revisited on a regular basis, as new information emerges, to ensure that it has remained valid.

In our Three Hills Scenario, Ryan should present his conclusion to the decision makers. Any supporting arguments discovered when the question was researched and when hypotheses were challenged should be included to help build the confidence necessary to receive buy-in across the insurance value chain. Additionally, he should include a plan to revisit the suggested question in a set amount of time, whether months or years, to ensure that the enacted solution is performing as required.

**Apply Your Knowledge**

Why is it important to critique and review both the initial hypothesis and any related challenges?

Feedback: A hypothesis formed by one party or one team may be the product of unrecognized biases or areas of ignorance. Challenging the hypothesis from all angles can expose these weaknesses, providing an opportunity to strengthen or replace the hypothesis. Similarly, the challenges themselves could be flawed, so should be subjected to the same scrutiny as the hypothesis itself.

**Summary**

Critical thinking can reveal underlying factors that contributed to a problem or scenario's emergence in ways that aren't immediately evident. As related problems and challenges are revealed, an opportunity is created: to include their remedies within the solution to the overarching issue. Applying the critical thinking process also presents opportunities for communication and collaboration within and among elements of the insurance value chain.

**Objective**

Demonstrate how a critical thinking process could be applied at various points along the insurance value chain.

As insurers grapple with increasingly complex challenges and opportunities, **critical thinking** ensures that leaders at all points along the value chain can be confident in their teams' decision-making abilities.

**Critical Thinking and the Insurance Value Chain**

[b]Critical Thinking and the Insurance Value Chain[/b]

The insurance value chain links the primary activities of marketing, underwriting, and claims, along with the various support activities, together to create a better customer experience. When the value chain is incorporated into the critical thinking process, an insurer's entire enterprise helps to identify the parameters of a challenge or opportunity, gather information, and develop and refine hypotheses regarding the best course of action. This collaboration, having those different points of view, can help to highlight underlying factors that may have otherwise gone unnoticed, allowing for a more comprehensive and helpful conclusion.

**Underwriting**

Although **artificial intelligence (AI)** processes continue to take on more rate and premium determination activities, insurers still need human intervention to ensure the integrity of the data used in the AI calculations. As advanced as AI can be, the ethical balance of an insurer's data model depends on its underwriters' ability to critically assess the available data and determine which aspects of it are fair to use and which could be seen as discriminatory.

**Why Data Ethics Matters**

[b]Why Data Ethics Matters[/b]

The data that actuaries use to build models isn't just an amalgam of random information. It's the by-product of people's lives. In fact, it often includes what many consider extremely personal details about individuals' behaviors and health.

In addition, the data points don't just paint a picture of individuals' past lives. They also have a profound effect on consumers' future. For example, they can determine who has access to insurance and how much they'll pay for it.

These factors compel actuaries to build models that are both fair and transparent. Fairness ensures that underwriting and rating decisions are based on factors that are truly predictive of risk, not factors that consumers often deem unfair, such as sex, marital status, religion, and national origin. Meanwhile, transparency allows insurers to explain and justify the modeling process and its outcomes to both consumers and regulators. In other words, without transparency, it would be impossible to determine which models are, in fact, fair.

Because of their importance, data models used for risk selection and pricing are often a source of competitive advantage. For example, an insurer that prices policies based on historical records of weather events may be at a disadvantage to an insurer that prices policies using a model that considers the effects of climate change. Both models are valid, but the latter is more likely to protect the insurer from claims totals that exceed expectations. However, an underwriter developing a data model that integrates forecasts that include climate change or the emergence of wildfire risks needs to consider the source of the data gathered, its reputation for accuracy, and its potential biases.

A lack of historical data for AIs to analyze isn't limited to weather events. Manufacturing processes are destined to change with the continuing evolution of 3-D printing, creating new risks to consider when determining coverage needs. The use of AI itself will create new risks, as well as reduce or eliminate historical causes of loss, such as employee fatigue or inexperience.

In commercial underwriting, critical thinking not only plays a role in analyzing data associated with complex applications for coverage, but also in cementing relationships as a risk management partner to covered businesses. For example, critical thinking could provide the catalyst for an insurer to help a covered business establish geographically distinct warehouses for its products, minimize the chances of a catastrophic loss, or provide new training for employees to take advantage of bleeding-edge technologies and safety features. 

**Apply Your Knowledge**

What makes an insurer's predictive model fair and transparent?

*Feedback*

A fair model enables an insurer to make risk and pricing decisions based on data that's both accurate and truly predictive of the expected future cost of coverage.

A transparent model allows an insurer to demonstrate the rationale for risk-related decisions and illustrates how it collects and uses consumer data. It counters the perception that insurers make decisions based on results from so-called ""black boxes"" that generate mysterious calculations from consumer data.

**Claims**

Claims data and its collection is becoming more sophisticated, giving rise to more opportunities for more advanced forms of claims fraud. For example, the constantly increasing volume of online transactions makes it easier for perpetrators to hide a needle of fraud in a haystack of legitimate claims and access vast amounts of customer data to help make fraudulent claims. Every online movement of money creates an opportunity for fraud.

Apps and online forms will make claims processes more automated, giving the customer more control over such processes and resulting in a quicker turnaround of claims, improving the customer experience. However, claims representatives will still need to determine which claims may be fraudulent. Working across the insurance value chain, they'll collaborate with underwriters, risk managers, and customer service representatives to identify common sources of unusually high claims, such as a medical center that overcharges patients or a law practice that represents several claimants who suffered suspiciously large losses. 

Claims representatives, just like underwriters, must consider the sources, biases, and reputations for accuracy for the data they use in their investigations. 

Although most claims activities will become automated, the area in general will remain an insurer's most important customer touchpoint. Critical thinking helps claims leaders consider new and innovative ways to leverage the customer-contact possibilities presented by the claims process.

**Marketing**

Critical thinking, when used in marketing, can create a competitive edge in several ways.

**Recognize the Need for New Products**

Marketing departments keep an eye on the marketplace in hopes of discovering needs to address through new product offerings. However, the chances for success increase when they include employees from other areas of the insurance value chain to offer alternative insights and viewpoints.

For example, the Marketing Department of an insurer looking to increase its share of the personal lines market might work with the underwriting, claims, and information technology (IT) departments to identify new product opportunities. This collaboration could uncover an unmet demand for personal cyber insurance policies and propose a plan for creating such a policy to the insurer's decision makers.

**Segment Markets to Reveal New Customers**

Increased access to data and the ability to process it has widened insurers' reach, enabling them to segment and penetrate previously unknown audiences. It's also led to exponential increases in insurers' ability to create, refine, and market insurance products. However, neither of these are possible without using critical thinking to determine which **customer segments** and insurance products are most beneficial to the insurer.

When paired with **target marketing** and **product targeting**, effective market segmentation improves an insurer's marketing return on investment. This is achieved by creating messaging and products optimized for—and targeted to—the audience most likely to be receptive to them, whether it's an existing customer base or a new demographic target.

For example, an insurer considering entry into a new geographic market can assess whether that area has unmet needs that align with its product offerings; if there's a need for which it can create such a product or service; and how it should design advertising that targets the segment. These efforts can help differentiate the insurer from the competition.

**Rethink Distribution Models**

As mobile apps and website functions become more important for customer acquisition and retention, marketing departments will want to maintain the constant flow of new ideas and proposals for reaching both current insureds and new demographics. 

Having a critical thinking process or team can help the Marketing Department take advantage of the technical expertise of the IT Department and the customer familiarity of the customer service team. Together, they can brainstorm and research ways to reach new customers and meet the next generation of insurance customers where they can be found, whether online or in the physical world.

**Apply Your Knowledge**

What are some ways an insurer could enhance the value of its auto coverage policies for new customers?

*Feedback*

An insurer could set up a notification system for routine maintenance depending on the make and model of its customers' autos. It could also provide updates on the status of covered repairs, or track the auto's value over time and notify the insured when it might be financially viable to lower the limits of or remove specific coverages, such as comprehensive coverage.

**Summary**

The insurance value chain links the activities of marketing, underwriting, and claims, along with various support activities, to create a better customer experience. When insurers incorporate the value chain into the critical thinking process, their entire enterprise helps identify the parameters of a challenge or opportunity, gather information, and develop and refine hypotheses regarding the best course of action. The various points of view provided by this collaboration can highlight underlying factors that may have otherwise gone unnoticed, enabling a more comprehensive and helpful conclusion.

**Objective**

Apply critical thinking skills to insurance business problems.

Key components of critical thinking are questioning assumptions, recognizing and avoiding biases, and gathering reliable information—important skills when investigating claims fraud and assessing an insured's leadership.

The information insurance professionals receive in a claim file or application for coverage may not always tell the whole story. The application of critical thinking could uncover data that might alter the outcome of the claims or application process. Let's take a look at how the process can help determine whether a claim is legitimate or evaluate the leadership of an insured.

**Investigating Claims Fraud**

Insurance professionals can position themselves to make appropriate, fact-based decisions by obtaining relevant information from reliable sources.

**Using Critical Thinking to Fight Fraud**

Maria, a claims representative, is investigating a homeowners claim for the theft of personal items from the trunk of an auto the week before Christmas. Daniel, the insured, submitted a lengthy list of toys and sports equipment that were stolen from the trunk. He stated that the items were all Christmas presents for his family and that the trunk was the only place he could hide the gifts. Daniel also said that he paid cash for most of the items and left the receipts in the bags in the trunk. He is claiming that the total value of the items in the trunk exceeds $10,000.

Maria's conversation with Daniel raises her suspicions. Although she believes that hiding Christmas presents in an auto's trunk and keeping the receipts with the items could be considered reasonable behavior, she questions whether paying cash for all these items is reasonable. She also questions whether physical evidence would support the claim that all the items in their original boxes could fit into the trunk of the insured's 2018 Ford Fusion.

Claims representatives must balance a suspicion of fraud with the possibility that a claim is legitimate, despite the presence of fraud indicators. Maria should investigate the claim further before alienating Daniel and burdening the SIU. When Maria asks Daniel whether there is a police report, he states that he lost it and does not recall which police precinct responded. Maria now has another fraud indicator that confirms her suspicions may be correct.

**Apply Your Knowledge**

Maria has identified several indicators of fraud in Daniel's claim of stolen gifts. What do you think her next step should be?

*Feedback*

Maria could next ask Daniel for the names of the stores he bought the gifts from. These businesses might have records that confirm or refute Daniel's claim. And depending on the insurer's guidelines, she may refer the claim to a special investigation unit (SIU).

**Assessing an Insured's Leadership**

Objective information is critical to insurer operations, but subjective evaluations are also important. When evaluating the ability and quality of a business's leadership, for example, the information in a standard insurance application and financial disclosures can go only so far; to assess less tangible but equally important qualitative characteristics of its leadership, the underwriter's ultimate judgment will also incorporate factors such as firsthand knowledge of the account, the account's reputation, and more.

**Evaluating French Rock Medical Equipment**

Andy, an underwriter for a commercial insurer, is evaluating a business insurance application from a midsize specialty manufacturer named French Rock Medical Equipment that has been in business for 10 years. Andy has reviewed the information in the application, but he knows that in order to properly evaluate French Rock's leadership, he'll need to consider other types of information as well.

What additional factors should Andy analyze?

First, Andy looks at French Rock's management personnel, because a successful business needs managers who can plan for the future, motivate employees, and organize and control operations. He finds that all of French Rock's managers have at least five years' experience with the company, and many worked in management roles with previous employers. Andy also looked into some of French Rock's past contracts and found that under these managers, the company has a good record of completing projects on time and within budget.

Another important indicator of leadership's abilities is the business's prudence of operations. Andy knows that companies sometimes expand too rapidly and overextend their resources and staff, or they may take on new types of projects that they aren't experienced with. In looking over French Rock's growth and the work it has done in past years, Andy determines that French Rock has a history of taking on only appropriate contracts and that it's not in danger of exceeding its capabilities.

This also suggests that French Rock has a good reputation in its field, but Andy investigates this aspect further to confirm. He finds few complaints to the Better Business Bureau, and online reviews from various websites are largely positive. Andy also checks French Rock's loss history and sees no issues related to products liability or low-quality work. He is now confident that French Rock has skilled management that is known for delivering on promises to clients.

But what about the frontline employees? Andy knows that quality organizations need quality employees. Quality employees are well trained and experienced, and companies that offer competitive compensation are more likely to attract them. Andy learns that French Rock's company policy is to require a minimum amount of job-related training and education for each employee, which is documented by Human Resources. Company records also indicate that employees participate in regular safety meetings as well as training related to equipment, processes, and injury prevention.

Andy then examines employee experience and retention. Based on company records compared against industry benchmarks and data from the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics, Andy determines that French Rock's employees are largely full time and have an appropriate amount of experience on average. Andy is also pleased to note that French Rock offers better-than-average compensation and typically retains its employees longer than competitors do. This also suggests strong employee loyalty and high morale.

Finally, Andy turns to French Rock's risk management. French Rock employs a chief risk officer, or CRO, and maintains an official risk management program. The CRO reports directly to French Rock's top management and has extensive authority, unlike some companies in which such a role might be limited to simply selecting an insurance policy. French Rock's favorable loss history supports Andy's judgment that the company is effectively managing its risk.

After completing this evaluation, Andy can confidently approve French Rock Medical Equipment's application.

**Check Your Understanding**

While underwriting a commercial insurance application for Diversified Cookware, Inc. (DCI), Emma gathers information about the applicant's management. She learns that DCI's president, Marco, previously worked for 20 years as a physical therapist in a sports medicine clinic. He started DCI 4 years ago and is respected by his former employer and co-workers.

Of DCI's 25 employees, 5 have worked for the company for the entire 4 years, 9 replaced workers who left the company, and 11 have taken newly created positions as the business expanded. Based on this information, what underwriting concerns relating to DCI's management might Emma have?

*Feedback*

Emma may have some concerns about Marco's lack of experience as a manager, noting that although he worked for 20 years before starting DCI, his past experience was not in management and is unrelated to cookware. She may also be concerned about employee turnover, noting that 9 out of the total of 25 employees were replaced in the past 4 years.

**Summary**

Because insurance involves countless decisions and judgments, critical thinking is one of the most important skills for anyone in the industry. The ability to set assumptions aside and instead identify and analyze relevant information can guide both business decisions and career advancement."

[url=https://learning.theinstitutes.org/mod/scorm/player.php?a=41776&currentorg=TOC1&scoid=83606]Fundamentals of Effective Communication[/url][/color]

**Objective**

Determine the most effective methods for communicating with internal and external stakeholders.

Effective communication habits are integral to business success, playing a vital role in efficient collaboration, employee engagement, client relationships, profitability, and risk management. Those who invest time and energy into developing strong communication practices can quickly build trust among executives, decision makers, team members, and subordinates.

Clear workplace communication increases productivity, reduces confusion, mitigates conflict, and improves morale. The communication process involves speaking and writing skills, as well as analytical and organizational skills. Good communicators also actively work at becoming good listeners and foster two-way dialogue.

**What Do You Know?**

When disagreeing or identifying difficulties with a co-worker or someone outside the organization, is it better to use an ""I"" message or a ""you"" message?

**The Communication Process**

Before speaking with a group or individual, it's important to step back and establish a plan that ensures the most clear and productive communication process. Here are some ways to do this:

- Set a clear communication objective
- Analyze your audience  
- Decide when and where to talk
- Pay attention to your body language
- Ask for feedback

If the communication involves identifying problems or disagreeing with internal or external stakeholders, even more analysis and planning may be required to avoid, or at least minimize, conflict.

**Delivering Difficult Messages**

Sometimes you have to deliver messages that people won't want to hear-- messages that bring a high potential for conflict. But there are ways to minimize or prevent defensive reactions.

Consider a conversation between Henry, a claims rep, and his supervisor, Diego. Diego has noticed that Henry has been falling behind on his work and failing to follow up with claimants properly. Henry has also been showing up late to work more often. How can Diego have a productive conversation with Henry about these issues?

First, Diego should avoid direct personal blame. Instead he can make it clear that he objects to specific kinds of behavior and performance levels. So instead of saying, for example, ""You really messed this claim up, Henry,"" he could say, ""I don't like how this turned out"".

It's also important to avoid broad generalizations and words like ""always,"" ""never,"" and ""all"". Instead, Diego should state specifically what he disagrees with. So, instead of, ""You're always late to work,"" Diego could say, ""I noticed you were late two days this week"".

Lastly, Diego should avoid sounding hostile when trying to be assertive. It's okay to show conviction, but hostility implies that the other person is to blame and increases conflict. For example, Diego should avoid ""you"" messages, judgmental phrases, generalizations, loud and angry tones of voice, and unwavering eye contact.

**Active Listening**

Few people are born good listeners. And despite the fact that listening is a critical part of effective communication, many people neglect their listening skills. But if you're not practicing active listening, chances are you're hindering your ability to communicate effectively. 

Active listeners set aside their judgments and instead try to empathize with the speaker's concerns. They adopt a conscious process of eliciting information, perceptions, and feelings. Active listening does more than generate information; it also helps develop trust and a good working relationship.

**Barriers to Active Listening**

Active listening consists of three elements: attention, suspension of judgment, and response.

**Attention**

Many people have a short attention span, and between phone notifications, the sights and sounds in one's environment, and personal thoughts, there's no shortage of distractions. Active listening demands a concentrated effort to focus completely on what the speaker is saying. 

One helpful technique to maintain attention when speaking is to pay frequent attention to the nonverbal signals given by the listener. In effect, you pause periodically to scan for messages conveyed through body language and facial expressions. A technique when listening is to mirror the posture and gestures of the speaker, when appropriate. For example, when they lean forward, you should too. 

**Suspension of Judgment**

It's important to withhold judgments, especially good/bad and right/wrong ones, about the message or speaker during the presentation. Any hint of disapproval can give the speaker reason to hesitate sharing information. 

While withholding judgment can improve active listening in just about any situation, it's particularly important among members of the same team or group. Even a nonverbal indication of disapproval can interfere with the speaker's statements.

**Response**

Active listening involves responding appropriately. The overall guideline is to avoid introducing a new idea. 

With active listening, the speaker should maintain control of the conversation. Listeners can help by paraphrasing the speaker's comments and checking their understanding of them. Listeners should not interject a thought that steers the discussion in a new direction; this isn't likely to help the speaker reveal ideas and feelings that lie beneath the surface, which is a goal of active listening.

**The Paraphrase Response**

How can you practice active listening in your day-to-day communication with others? Active listening often employs three steps: listening to a message; paraphrasing, or restating in your own words, the message you received; and confirming the paraphrased message with the speaker. For example, you might say, ""What I hear you saying is such-and-such--is this correct?""

**Two-Way Communication**

Part of becoming an effective communicator means making people feel comfortable coming to you with information and ideas. 

Individuals at all levels of an organization should feel comfortable communicating both up and down the chain of command. Supervisors need to listen to and receive feedback not just from their supervisors, but from their employees.

Managers and supervisors can cultivate two-way communication by maintaining an open-door policy, encouraging employees to express feelings as well as facts, asking employees for their opinions, rewarding employees for reporting problems and then following up with employees on those problems, and providing timely answers to employee questions.

**Let's Hear From an Expert: Rita Williams-Bogar**

When communicating with stakeholders, there are a number of factors to keep in mind. First and foremost, know your objective. What is it you're looking to accomplish with this communications? Are you looking to inform, to persuade, to seek support for an idea? What action is going to be required?

Secondly, have you identified the correct stakeholder? Is the person or entity with whom you're communicating appropriate for the topic and appropriate for your objective?

Thirdly, identify the best method that the stakeholder wishes to be communicated with. If you have someone who prefers face-to-face communications, determine how you can facilitate that, whether physically in person or using technology, or even the telephone. Does your stakeholder prefer to be communicated with electronically, using email, for example?

Fourth, please make sure your communication flows in a logical sequence. People are busy; they like to know what is coming, what needs to be done, and by when. Have you answered the question, What's in it for me?, from the stakeholder's perspective? Why should they invest their time in whatever it is you're choosing to communicate with them?

And lastly, identify the action that you are requesting of them. Are they to follow up with someone else? Are they to get back to you by a certain date or time? What assistance will they be rendering? What decision must they be making, and by what date?

Keep these factors in mind if you'd like to streamline the communications with your stakeholders and achieve stronger outcomes.

**Send ""I"" Messages**

Managers and supervisors should also practice using ""I"" messages instead of ""you"" messages when they disagree with an employee or find problems with an employee's work.

When people are upset, they tend to express dissatisfaction through ""you"" messages, which imply that the other person is to blame for how the messenger feels. For example, ""Sebastian, you are making too many mistakes in your reports."" This type of finger-pointing actually obstructs two-way communication because it can deflate the recipient's confidence and make them reluctant to engage.

Using an ""I"" message, on the other hand, opens the door for a conversation about the issue. For example, ""I believe there are some problems with these reports that need to be corrected."" This is a much more constructive way to deliver the same criticism, and it invites the recipient to inquire about the specific problems.

**Support Diverse Groups**

While working with a diverse group of people has many advantages, it can also sometimes hinder communication. Having different backgrounds, skill sets, perspectives, communication styles, and experiences can sometimes impede collaboration. And if difficulties arise, some members of the group may take charge and push their ideas, possibly intimidating those who are more reserved.

In these situations, nondirective techniques can be used to encourage people to open up, speak freely, and express their ideas. Rather than directing the flow of conversation, nondirective techniques convey support for the speaker. These techniques include posing open-ended questions, asking for clarification, reflecting on the input of others, and empathizing.

**Check Your Understanding**

Conor is a technical support specialist in the information technology (IT) Department of Great Ocity, Inc. He is giving a presentation to his group on ways to direct workflows through the department. Luis, the IT manager, disagrees with many of Conor's ideas and is concerned that they will actually hurt productivity. At the same time, Luis wants his staff members to be better active listeners and does not want to discourage progress in this area. Describe what Luis should do to foster active listening among his team members during the presentation.

# Summary

Effective communication habits are essential to business success. Good communication increases productivity, reduces confusion, mitigates conflict, and improves morale. The communication process includes speaking, analytical, and organizational skills. In addition to helping the listener obtain information, active listening develops trust and positive relationships. Good communicators foster two-way communication by sending ""I"" messages and supporting diversity through nondirective techniques."

[color=blue]
[url=https://learning.theinstitutes.org/mod/scorm/player.php?a=41777&currentorg=TOC1&scoid=83608]Selecting the Best Form of Communication[/url][/color]

**Objective**

Select the ideal form of communication, given your audience and purpose.

As digital communications have moved to the forefront of almost every business transaction, mastering and maintaining digital literacy has become essential to providing ongoing value to employers and customers. Simply familiarizing yourself with the available forms of communication (such as emails, phone calls, and text messages) is not enough: Critical to successful interactions is knowing the best time to use each.

The digitization of the marketplace allows insurers to reduce costs and create a better customer experience. But to realize these benefits, insurers' employees must know how to best employ the corresponding communication tools. 

Sometimes, casual conversation and colloquialisms will be acceptable or even preferred; other times, a more formal tone and delivery will be necessary. Not being able to differentiate between the two can have disastrous results, ranging from hurt feelings to loss of business, and even damage to the company's reputation.

**Emilia and Sofia**

Emilia is a claims representative who has been helping Sophia make a claim after a tornado destroyed her home. Because Sophia is a single parent with two children, Emilia finds herself more concerned with the status of the claim than she otherwise might be.

Emilia wants to check in on Sophia and her children via text over the weekend but knows that doing so in the wrong manner, such as by coming across as overly familiar or making promises or suggestions she shouldn't, could cause issues for her employer.

As we review the methods of communication available to professionals and the best uses of each, keep Emilia's situation in mind. Later, we'll revisit it and discuss whether contacting Sophia by text is a good idea.

**Understanding Your Audience**

When it comes to delivering a message, the intended audience is just as important as the message itself. For example, phrasing and means of sharing an update on the status of a claim might be executed differently depending on whether the update is being provided to the claims rep's supervisor or the claimant. 

Additionally, if the audience is more likely to have questions, such as a potential customer who is exploring coverage solutions or a board of directors looking for updates on an important project, the means of communication should provide an opportunity for them to ask those questions. 

**Check Your Understanding**

Consider the claim Emilia is working on, in which Sofia's home was destroyed by a tornado. Suppose she received an inquiry regarding the status of the claim. How might the audience affect the way she delivered the update—say, if it were her immediate supervisor as compared with the claimant?

*Feedback*

Depending on Emilia's relationship with her supervisor, her status update regarding the claim might be a casually phrased email or a quick drop-by conversation in the supervisor's office. For the claimant, however, the update would probably take the form of a more formal phone call, letter, or email that could be recorded in the claim file.

**Choosing a Medium**

Insurance professionals communicate with customers and each other in a variety of ways, including face-to-face meetings, written correspondence, telephone calls, email, text messages, newsletters, and the internet. All of these media will not be equally effective in communicating a given message. For example, if the objective is to explain coverage to an insured, a face-to-face meeting would be most appropriate. A meeting would allow the insured to ask questions, while a letter or an email, for example, would likely be overwhelmingly long and not allow adequate opportunity for discussion. 

If a message is short and requires only a yes/no response, a phone call or email message would be effective. If general information needs to be disseminated to a large number of people, website updates and newsletters are appropriate.

**Types of Business Communication**

Several types of communication can be employed in the course of a business day.

Oral communication generally takes place between at least two people in real time, such as in meetings (whether in person or by video), by phone, or through speeches. It allows for direct interaction, including asking questions or clarifying certain points. However, it is a time-consuming method of communicating, often without a record of the exchange.

Written messages include texts, emails, or letters. They provide an opportunity for conversation, but feedback can be delayed. However, they have the benefit of providing a permanent record of the communication. For this reason, many government regulations require communications that are necessary in the course of insurance transactions, such as policy renewals or cancellations, to be done in written format.

Visual communication often includes a presentation, such as a PowerPoint slideshow, whether accompanied by oral remarks or distributed on its own. Visual communications are often able to convey complex ideas but may require specific production skills not everyone has.

Nonverbal communication takes place whenever one party is speaking to another, whether in person, on the phone, or on a video call. It may include an averted gaze, nervous shifting, or a spontaneous wince or smile. Controlling your body language and facial expressions, as well as maintaining eye contact, are important to establishing a rapport with the audience. If a speaker looks uncomfortable while presenting information, it's unlikely the audience will have confidence in what they're being told.

Considerations when determining which method of communication to use include:

- Is receiving immediate feedback important?
- Is having a written record of the communication necessary?
- Is the information being delivered confidential?

For example, a supervisor should not discuss salary details in a group setting; it would be more appropriate to have a personal discussion with each employee in private. Similarly, if a customer service representative needs to ask a supervisor a question before responding to a customer on a phone call, the rep should not send the question by email or interoffice mail. Either calling or speaking in person with the supervisor would provide better service for the customer, who likely anticipates immediate feedback.

**Need More Information?**

Any business communication can be described as synchronous, which means all of the parties are interacting at the same time (such as on a video call or in a chat group), or asynchronous, which means they aren't (such as when copies of a letter are mailed to several recipients).

**Apply Your Knowledge**

What are some additional factors that could influence the medium used to communicate with an audience?

*Feedback*

Also influencing the choice of medium are cost, familiarity with the audience, relationship with the audience, formality of the topic, and skill or ability of the communicator in regard to a specific medium.

**Communicating in the Insurance Industry**

Insurance remains a document-driven industry, with hard copies still standard for quotation letters, binding letters, reservation of rights letters, and policies themselves. Being able to communicate complicated ideas in clear, concise writing is crucial to the professional success and financial health of an insurer. A miswritten quote or reply to a claim that was filed could unnecessarily require an insurer to cover a loss.

Email remains a preferred method of communication among insurers because of its ability to create a secure record of conversations as they happen. However, texting has grown in popularity with customers, given its convenience and ease of use.

**Let's Hear From an Expert: Keith Pic**

Claims professionals can ensure that their text-based messages are effective by understanding that we lose a lot of communication when we're not face to face. So every punctuation mark--every comma, period, exclamation point--that all matters, and when a claimant reads it, they can interpret it different ways.

So if it degrades from there, the claims professional needs to get that back onto the point or explain what they're explaining. It's a mode of communication that just isn't that effective, in my opinion, but it's something that can be expected from the claimants.

As we're continually evolving and we're handling claims different ways and customers and claimants and insureds have different expectations. It's just one thing that the claims professional needs to understand.

Face-to-face meetings also play a critical role in how the business of insurance is conducted. Being able to build a rapport with customers, understand their exposures, and address any concerns they might have about an insurer's policies can give an agent or producer an advantage over competitors. 

Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic limited the amount of in-person communication, requiring unprecedented levels of virtual communication. Being empathetic if a customer shows hesitancy toward meeting in person can help create the same kind of rapport, particularly when followed up with alternative means of effective communication.

**Check Your Understanding**

Think back to Emilia's situation. She was considering contacting Sofia, a claimant, by text over the weekend to check in on her and her children. What should Emilia consider before doing this?

*Feedback*

Although texting with claimants has become an acceptable form of communication for insurance professionals, doing so at unexpected hours or on off days, such as over a weekend, could seem intrusive and be perceived as unwelcome. To avoid this, Emilia could send a more formal email or call during regular business hours. She should also take care not to let her empathy cloud her judgment. For example, she wouldn't want to make promises that go beyond the scope of her employer's obligation, such as offering to pay for losses or accommodations that are not covered by Sofia's policy.

**Summary**

Having digital literacy entails being familiar with the various forms of communication that are available (such as emails, phone calls, and text messages), as well as the best time to use each. Sometimes, casual conversation and colloquialisms will be acceptable or even preferred; other times, a more formal tone and delivery will be necessary. Differentiating between the two requires understanding your audience, considering your message, and being mindful of standard practices in insurance. Not being able to differentiate between the two can have disastrous results, ranging from hurt feelings to loss of business, and even damage to the company's reputation."

**Objective**

Demonstrate best practices for leading in-person, virtual, and hybrid meetings.

Leading an effective meeting that delivers a clear message, sparks engagement, and generates results requires more than being a great speaker. An organized, tactical approach to planning and executing the meeting is also needed.

**A Meeting Gone Wrong**

[b]A Meeting Gone Wrong.[/b]

Meet Jin. She manages the Claims Department for RestSecured Insurance Company. On most days, half of her department is in the office, and the other half is working from home or on the road. So most department meetings are hybrid.

Jin called today's meeting to discuss some recent trends regarding fraudulent claims activity. The room is equipped with a camera, so that those joining remotely can see her, as well as a microphone and speaker so that everyone can communicate.

After explaining what the meeting will cover, Jin distributes a fraudulent claims report to the team. She emails it to those joining the meeting remotely and provides hard copies for those attending in person. She then gives the team several minutes to review the report.

Next, she asks attendees to share what jumps out at them from the report. After a long silence, Mario starts to speak but is interrupted by a dog barking through the speaker. Then, Lucy and Stanley begin having a side conversation about what they've noticed in the report.

Looking around, Jin notices people losing focus and becoming frustrated.

Meetings are changing. 

The days of counting on gathering everyone in the same room are no more. Instead, the modern workforce is a mix of in-office employees, telecommuters, and road warriors. Everyone can't always be in the same place at the same time, and that's OK. Technology allows us to connect.

But there's a big difference between connecting employees and getting them engaged. Engagement in meetings won't occur unless employees feel their time is put to good use and their involvement is valued. 

How could Jin have fostered more engagement in her meeting? Let's find out.

**Creating a Better Meeting Experience**

[b]Creating a Better Meeting Experience.[/b]

There are several best practices Jin could have followed to foster more engagement from her department.

For example, she could have made sure everyone was on camera. This would have allowed everyone to see who's talking and read their body language. And it would have helped those joining remotely feel like they're on equal footing with those in the office.

Next, Jin could have muted those joining remotely to prevent unwanted background noise from interrupting the meeting or distracting participants. Individuals could have unmuted themselves if they had something to contribute.

Jin could have also distributed the claims report prior to the meeting to give her department ample time to review and gather their thoughts on it.

Finally, Jin could have set ground rules for the meeting to quash any side conversations or other distracting behaviors that could stifle engagement.

In-person, virtual, and hybrid meetings can all be equally effective—but only if proper preparation, participant management, and follow-up go into them.

**Preparing for the Meeting**

Great preparation often means the difference between leading an effective meeting and a mediocre one. By taking several critical steps, you can ensure that attendees find the meeting valuable, engaging, and productive.

First, determine whether the meeting is really necessary. Can the discussion take place via email or online chat, or does it require a more traditional conversation? An unnecessary meeting is much less likely to be effective—and much more likely to cause resentment among attendees.

Similarly, you'll want to determine who really needs to attend. The benefits of eliminating unnecessary attendees are twofold: It allows performers to best use their time, and it enables a more efficient meeting by limiting the discussion to key stakeholders.

When sending the meeting invitation, include an agenda for the meeting that clearly outlines the objective(s). This is also a good time to distribute supplementary materials and note any questions that attendees should be prepared to discuss. Providing materials in advance gives attendees more time to digest them.

The next step is to prepare for the meeting from a technical standpoint. This requires testing your technology and practicing how to use it.

**What Needs to Work?**

Get attendees involved early in the meeting process by asking them for any questions or suggestions they have related to the meeting's agenda or materials. When possible, use their feedback to add to the discussion. This lets attendees know their voices matter, which sparks further engagement.

Finally, log into the meeting early (and ask participants to do the same) to check that their audio, video, and presentation tools work. This will help prevent wasting precious meeting time fixing technical issues.

**Apply Your Knowledge**

Jin has to give an important presentation to key executives on how the Claims Department plans to handle suspect claims moving forward. How would you suggest she identify and prevent anything that may interfere with the executives' ability to understand her presentation?

*Feedback*

You could suggest that Jin conduct a dry run of her presentation. This will help her identify and prevent obstacles to learning that may affect executives during her live delivery. Further, a dry run will help ensure she's comfortable with the technology and provide a good estimate of the timing of her presentation.

**Meeting Preparation Checklist**

[Image of a meeting preparation checklist]

**Managing Participants**

Maximizing engagement requires managing participants to encourage their involvement and minimize distracting behavior.

As the leader of the meeting, a key part of managing participants is managing yourself properly so that you don't do anything that may cause a distraction or disinterest. This means arriving prepared so that you're not shuffling through your notes. If you're to be on screen, avoid a cluttered background, and make sure your face is in the frame and that you make eye contact with the camera. You should also arrive early (or be the first to log on) to greet attendees as they arrive.

In virtual and hybrid meetings, make sure everyone is on-screen and facing the camera. This can help avoid confusion, which can occur when people in the room talk and those joining remotely can't see them. It's also wise to mute everyone's microphone at the start of the meeting. This ensures that background noise, such as barking dogs and traffic, doesn't become a distraction.

**Need More Information?**

Watch for visual cues that someone wants to speak, such as unmuting a microphone or raising a hand. Even if attendees are simply aware that you're watching for these signs, they'll be more inclined to participate in the conversation.

You can set the tone for active participation by introducing online attendees and encouraging a remote worker to be the first to react to or join the discussion. This gets off-site employees involved right away and makes them feel included and valued.

Another way to encourage participation is to assign roles to attendees. For example, someone can take notes and another can be the timekeeper.

Next, it's important to reiterate the objective(s) of the meeting and establish ground rules for the discussion. 

**Ground Rules for Meetings**

**Apply Your Knowledge**

How would you recommend that Jin handle questions or comments that don't contribute to the main objective of the meeting and could needlessly prolong the discussion?

*Feedback*

Any items that are not related to the current meeting's agenda can be placed in the meeting ""parking lot."" This is a record of questions, comments, suggestions, and topics that should (and will) be addressed at another time.

When the attention or enthusiasm of the audience begins to wane, have a plan for how to bring attendees' focus back. This can include discussion ideas, questions, games, and brainstorming activities. Conversely, you may determine that it's time to simply end the meeting. Once participants have lost interest, the value in continuing the discussion is likely negligible.

Finally, it's important to end the meeting on time—or early, if warranted. This shows respect for attendees' time. Allowing meetings to run long sets a bad precedent, which could make employees wary of or less enthusiastic about participating in future meetings.

**Following Up**

A proper meeting follow-up can effectively spur action, trigger accountability, and drive results. 

Meetings often include long conversations that can leave participants unsure of what was decided and what their role is moving forward. As a result, meetings should be bookended by follow-up communications that explicitly note the conclusions, next steps, and specific assignments.

**Follow-Up Email Content**

Any follow-up messages should be clear and concise to avoid misunderstandings and confusion about what was discussed and now needs to happen. People won't read long-winded summaries.

**Summary**

The three keys to leading effective meetings are preparation, participant management, and follow-up. Proper preparation requires setting an agenda, inviting necessary stakeholders, and getting comfortable with the technical tools that will be used. Participant management entails making sure everyone can be seen and heard, assigning roles, and establishing ground rules. Follow-up communications need to clearly and concisely state what was decided and what still needs to be accomplished.

[color=blue]
[url=https://learning.theinstitutes.org/mod/scorm/player.php?a=41779&currentorg=TOC1&scoid=83612]Fundamentals of Effective Collaboration[/url][/color]

**Objective**

Determine the most effective methods for collaborating with internal and external stakeholders.

Insurers are made up of individuals with specialized knowledge and skills in different areas who must work together to achieve organizational goals. Being an effective collaborator helps you engage stakeholders from all levels and points on the insurance value chain to work as a team toward common goals.

Collaboration typically requires regular communication and information sharing, and the members of the collaborative team must monitor its progress.

**What Do You Know?**

Collaboration, cooperation, and coordination are not the same. Each has its own meaning, and it's important to differentiate them so there's no misunderstanding when an employee is asked to collaborate, coordinate, or cooperate with an internal or external stakeholder. Can you explain the differences between the three?

*Feedback*

Collaboration is working together to achieve a shared objective. Cooperation is working together to achieve individual objectives instead of a shared objective. Finally, coordination involves improving efficiency and reducing redundancy by some combination of arranging, assigning, organizing, or scheduling activities. For example, while two people may cooperate with each other by sharing information and resources, they might not be doing this to accomplish the same objective.

Because failure or success in one area would likely affect another, different business units and their managers must understand each other's vulnerabilities and opportunities and work as a team to achieve overarching organizational goals. This often means dovetailing the work of one unit with that of others. It may even mean giving up control to other people or sacrificing some efficiency or convenience in one area to help another.

In this section, we explore three keys to effective collaboration: gaining a holistic perspective, motivating workers, and contributing toward a common goal.

**Holistic Risk Management Through Collaboration**

[b]Holistic Risk Management Through Collaboration[/b]

Cyber risk management is evolving, with new threats, exposures, and government regulations arising daily. To manage cyber risk, many professionals must work together. In addition to risk managers, brokers, underwriters, and claims professionals, here are examples of other key contributors to cyber risk management.

A company's chief information security officer plays a leading role in identifying and preventing cyber risks. Compliance professionals help to ensure adherence to state, federal, and international regulations. Attorneys may get involved in the event a breach occurs to mitigate loss and ensure adherence to the law.

Communications and public relations professionals may work to address reputational risk following a breach. A third-party vendor may be enlisted to monitor those affected by a breach. With so many moving parts and players, collaboration is key to effective cyber risk management.

Other technological risks could also require multiple teams or departments to collaborate. Picture this. You're a life science underwriter. A company has created a new, cutting-edge, life-saving medical device, and they're going to need insurance.

They'll likely need product recall insurance in case the new product malfunctions. If the product connects to the internet, they'll also need cyber insurance. In the event the manufacturing facility catches on fire, they may need more robust business interruption coverage to help them get back up and running and meet demand for the product following a loss.

You get the picture. There are a lot of risks involved, and they're not always black and white or fit within a box. As the underwriter on this account, you may need to consult with subject matter experts and other teams within your organization to ensure you can provide your client with the best possible coverage.

**Gain a Holistic Perspective**

The first step to fostering collaboration with stakeholders is developing a broad perspective of the insurer and its interactions with stakeholders, particularly the demands their managers place on them and what their work environments look like. Successful collaboration requires understanding the work that other departments and external stakeholders perform.

You don't have to become an expert on the work every stakeholder performs, but you do need to know enough about how different work processes interact to create an effective plan. The first step in this endeavor is understanding each unit's role and how it supports or depends on other units and stakeholders. Go beyond merely knowing what others do and master the points where everyone's workflows connect.

Developing a holistic perspective requires ongoing two-way communication with other departments and stakeholders. Establish and maintain good communications and relations with those stakeholders, and cultivate a sensitivity to lapses in effective communication. When key stakeholders fail to communicate with each other, reestablish the connection.

**Let's Hear From an Expert: Rita Williams-Bogar**

[b]Let's Hear From an Expert: Rita Williams-Bogar[/b]

There may come a time where you find yourself in the middle of stakeholders who have suddenly, for whatever reason, stopped communicating and/or collaborating. There is a deliverable your manager is expecting from you. A client, perhaps, is awaiting an answer, or an employee or a colleague even needs your help and support, which you are unable to provide until the two or more stakeholders have begun communicating.

This will cause you to need to resort to going into conflict resolution mode. Meet with each stakeholder individually to find out what challenges or obstacles they may be facing [and] that could be impeding their progress to carry forward on their end of whatever the issue is. Approach this from the perspective of, ""I'd like to help you. I'd like to understand,"" rather than looking to assess blame or point fingers.

If at all possible, bring these multiple stakeholders together and put the differences on the table. They may find out that there is something that each one is facing that neither was aware of. Then, focus on the common ground. What's the goal? What is it you're looking to achieve? And what might be the best way for you to get there?

By having them focus on the issues and definitely not on the personalities--focus on the issues, focus on the processes, which helps to depersonalize it so that both parties, all parties, can move forward.

**Apply Your Knowledge**

What harm could result if one person regularly dominates the agenda at interdepartmental meetings? How could you respond?

*Feedback*

To foster effective communication, other people must be involved in the process. Communication that is always initiated by the same individual isn't effective over the long run because it limits the diversity of opinions; others must be given (and accept) the responsibility for starting communication. One way to encourage this is to find methods to get others involved. Supervisors in particular must periodically talk with and listen to each other about their units' quality of communication.

**Motivate Workers**

An essential part of getting people to collaborate is motivating them to work with others.

**Motivation Techniques**

[b]Motivation Techniques[/b]

These are some effective techniques for motivating supervisors, employees, customers, and other third parties to collaborate to achieve a shared goal.

Get to know as much as possible about the other stakeholders. What do they want, need, value, and hope to achieve in their careers? When people know that you're open to their point of view, they'll be more inclined to work with you.

Seek stakeholder input when making decisions. Being consulted is in itself a motivator. When the group is diverse, it expands the team's thinking and improves decision making, and seeking input from everyone fosters greater acceptance of decisions.

Examine how collaborators want to be rewarded. Do they want money, praise, promotions? Link the rewards they want with the work that needs to be done. Cite what must be done and provide rewards immediately after they succeed.

Seek feedback on your own performance from peers, managers, and subordinates. People want to team up with others who are accountable and amenable to criticism. When revising job duties, try to enrich individuals' work rather than merely expanding it.

Request and, if necessary, push for equipment, staff, and other resources to support stakeholders. Help team members see the big picture and understand how their work contributes to the achievement of a shared goal. Explain how collaboration affects them directly. This is far more motivating than just hearing how it affects the organization.

Other tactics, meanwhile, do just the opposite, serving to demotivate. For example:

- Making groups compete for resources
- Giving groups different goals and/or values
- Promoting competition among units
- Overloading some individuals with more work than others
- Praising in private but punishing in public
- Assuming that poor performance is a result of low motivation
- Focusing on a worker's personality rather than results
- Being biased toward the most senior person's ideas

**Contribute Toward a Common Goal**

Collaboration isn't about achieving individual goals; it requires an active commitment from every group member to achieve a single, shared goal. This doesn't mean that individuals can't reach their own goals along the way. But true collaboration requires the entire group to keep moving toward the same finish line. 

Group leaders must ensure that stakeholders don't veer off course. That starts by prioritizing the desired project results. 

Make sure everyone knows what group success looks like. Then, establish clear definitions and agreement on the roles each stakeholder will play on the way to the finish line and how performance will be measured. Don't move forward until all stakeholders have agreed on the methods that will be used to complete projects or tasks.

As work begins, group members should look for obstacles that can get in the way of the goal. When problems arise, the group should address them together. This aspect of teamwork is essential throughout the process.

**Achieving Shared Goals Through Teamwork**

[b]Achieving Shared Goals Through Teamwork[/b]

With so many different departments and individuals making up an insurer, it's critical that everyone gear their efforts toward the same goals. Think of a team in a tug of war: success depends on everyone literally pulling in the same direction. If someone strays from the group to pursue an individual goal or reward, it can jeopardize the project.

Making sure that everyone is pulling in the same direction means recognizing and rewarding teamwork. Basketball, hockey, and soccer teams do this by tracking assists along with goals. Organizations that reward employees for individual performances typically have less success in fostering collaboration. It's OK to reward great individual performances, but it's critical to reward teamwork.

**Check Your Understanding**

Amir, an underwriting manager, understands the role his department plays in his organization's goals. What is the first step he could take to foster interdepartmental collaboration?

*Feedback*

To foster interdepartmental collaboration, Amir should first develop a broad perspective of the organization, all its departments, and all managers' job functions. In particular, he needs to understand the demands that supervisors place on managers and what managers' work environments look like. Although he doesn't have to become an expert on every manager's work, Amir needs to know enough about how their work processes interact to create a plan for effective collaboration.

**Summary**

Collaboration happens when people or business units work together to achieve a single, shared goal. As business functions become more interconnected, collaboration becomes more critical. The first step in fostering collaboration is gaining a holistic perspective of the organization and stakeholders' interactions with it. Supervisors, employees, customers, and other third parties must be motivated to collaborate with each other. Group leaders must focus on preventing stakeholders from straying from the common goal."
"Strategic Decision Making","CPCU 500","2548","# The Insurer Strategic Management Process

[color=blue]
[url=https://learning.theinstitutes.org/mod/scorm/player.php?a=41669&currentorg=TOC1&scoid=83392]The Insurer Strategic Management Process[/url][/color]


**Objective**

Summarize the stages in an insurer strategic management process.

The strategic management process is critical to any insurer's success. To distinguish themselves in the highly regulated insurance industry, where products may not vary widely, insurers focus on developing small edges over other providers where possible—making strategic management critical for success.

Alignment of, and the external factors that affect, an insurer's internal resources is necessary to create a sustainable competitive advantage. The strategic management process involves strategy formulation (creating the plan), strategy implementation (putting the plan into action), and strategy evaluation (monitoring the results).

**What Do You Know?**

What is usually the first step in implementing a chosen strategy?

Feedback: Usually, the first step in implementing a strategy is to create a roadmap of how the strategy will be disseminated. This includes aligning all the processes, tasks, and responsibilities involved.

**Strategy Formulation**

Using an insurer's mission statement and vision statement, board members and senior-level executives develop strategies through a three-step process.

**Components of Strategy Formulation**

First, an insurer analyzes internal and external factors, including competitors, current and prospective customers' needs, the current and anticipated economy, and government regulations. It may employ a SWOT analysis to determine its competitive position within the market and how receptive the market would be to new offerings.

After completing its analysis, the insurer develops long-term strategies and goals that support its mission statement and represent its identity, customers, and purpose.

Finally, it unveils strategies at different administrative levels. This involves agreement on more-specific actions and delegation of responsibilities to achieve long-term strategies and goals. Such strategies are based on the insurer's core competencies, the competitive nature of the business, the potential customer base, and other factors. This step in the strategic management process involves specifying the who, what, and when regarding specific responsibilities.

**Strategy Implementation**

The first consideration in strategy implementation is determining the most appropriate organizational structure for a company based on its strategic goals. For example, in a single-line insurer, a functional structure might be most suitable, with departments defined by the operation they perform, such as claims, underwriting, and marketing. A diversified company, however, is more likely to use a multidivisional structure to organize its operations and segregate each division into separate profit centers.

Other possible structures organize a company's operations by region or type of product or customer. A large insurer, for example, might have separate underwriting departments for commercial, marine, and personal lines insurance. This way, the expertise and resources required for specific customers is concentrated within the related department. Such an approach supports a differentiation strategy, in which the company seeks to provide unique products for specific market segments.

Structure can also determine an insurer's reporting relationships or levels of vertical differentiation. Some insurers may be tall organizations, with many levels between functional-level positions and executive-level positions, while an insurer that follows a flat organization plan would have fewer levels between the executive offices and employees in the field.

When following a cost leadership strategy, flat organization helps to eliminate costs related to maintaining multiple reporting relationships within the company.

**Steps to Setting Strategy**

[b]Steps to Setting Strategy.[/b]

Once reporting relationships are determined, mid-level managers will generally take these steps to implement the organization's chosen strategy.

Create a roadmap of the processes, tasks, and responsibilities that will disseminate the strategy.

Communicate information regarding the strategies throughout the organization.

Assign responsibilities, tasks, authority, and accountability throughout the organization.

Allocate adequate resources for successful implementation.

Manage variances between the goals and mid-year results; make necessary adjustments to achieve the goals.

**Strategy Evaluation**

Strategy evaluation, also called strategic control, involves measuring a strategy's success. Management uses control mechanisms to gauge progress on integrating established strategies into an insurer's activities and achieving set goals. The process has four steps:

1. Establish standards.
2. Create and apply measurements.
3. Compare actual results to standards.
4. Evaluate and implement corrective actions if goals are not met.

Several categories of organizational controls may be used to monitor goals:

Financial: These include stock price, return on investment formulas, cost-benefit analyses, loss ratios, expense ratios, and combined ratios.

Operational or process: These include processes to monitor work flow, production processes, and customer service. In a claims department, such controls could include the average cost of settlement, average case load per adjuster, or file turnover rates for individual adjusters.

Human or behavior controls: These include rules, policies, and procedures that provide operating guidelines for employees within an insurer, including measurement of individual performance.

Consistent evaluation may provide the impetus for strategic plans to be reformed or their implementation to be adjusted.

**Example of Steps in the Control Process Applied to an Underwriting Department**

[b]Steps in the Control Process Applied to an Underwriting Department.[/b]

Let's take a look at how an underwriting department might set up its control process.

The first step is to establish standards. For example, they might use a combined ratio of under 100 as the standard. Combined ratios are usually readily available, which makes the ratio an appropriate and easily applied standard.

Step 2 is to create and apply measurements. The department opted to compile all premium, expense, and loss data required to develop a combined ratio figure for this individual office, as well as determining a format for reporting the data.

The Underwriting Department's third step was to compare the actual results to its chosen standards. An inherent part of this process is for managers to communicate the importance of meeting this standard to all employees and to motivate them to do so. These premium expense and loss reports will then be used in comparing actual results to the established standard of a combined ratio under 100. If the standard has not been met, managers will need to determine the reason and then implement changes.

Finally, the Underwriting Department would evaluate and implement corrective actions if goals are not met. Depending on the results of this comparison, corrective actions might involve training initiatives for employees, strengthening communications with producers, examining marketing activities, or taking other corrective actions. If the goal has been met, management should reward and recognize all employees involved, to provide motivation to achieve future strategic goals.

**Apply Your Knowledge**

A crucial component of strategy implementation is determining the most appropriate organizational structure for a company based on its strategic goals. What are two types of organizational structures that could result?

Feedback: Two types of organizational structures that can support an organization's strategy are functional and multidivisional. A functional structure might be most suitable to a single-business company, with departments defined by the operations they perform. A diversified company is more likely to use a multidivisional structure to organize its operations and to segregate each division into a separate profit center.

**Summary**

Insurers employ the strategic management process to align external factors and internal resources in order to create a sustainable competitive advantage. This three-step process includes strategy formulation, implementation, and evaluation.

**Glossary**

[url=https://learning.theinstitutes.org/mod/scorm/player.php?a=41670&currentorg=TOC1&scoid=83394]How Insurers Apply the Five Forces Model and SWOT Analysis[/url][/color]

**Objective**

Explain how an insurer can use the Five Forces and SWOT methods to analyze its operational environment.

To develop an effective business strategy, an insurer must analyze its internal and external environments to identify all possible threats and opportunities.

Insurers rely on the strategic management process to achieve long-term goals. At the start of the strategy formulation process, managers consider factors in both the general environment, which affects all businesses, and the task environment, which includes the organization's customers, competitors, and suppliers. The task environment describes environmental factors specific to the organization's industry.

Two methods insurers can use to analyze the task environment are the Five Forces Model and SWOT analysis.

**The Five Forces Model**

The widely used Five Forces Model, developed by Harvard Business School professor Michael E. Porter, analyzes the external task, or competitive, environment. This environment includes customers, competitors, and suppliers; for insurers, it also includes reinsurance providers and regulators.

[b]The Five Forces Model[/b]

Insurers use the strategic management process to help them achieve their long-term goals. The first step requires managers to consider factors in both the general environment and the task environment. The general environment affects all businesses, regardless of their industry, and includes demographic, sociocultural, legal, technological, economic, and global factors.

The task environment describes the environmental factors specific to the industry in which the business operates. For an insurance company, the task environment includes customers, competitors, suppliers, reinsurance providers, and regulators.

One of the methods insurers can use to analyze their environment is the Five Forces Model, which deals with the task environment to analyze customers, competitors, and suppliers. This model describes five forces that drive competition:

1. The threat of new entrants into the industry
2. The threat of substitute products or services  
3. The bargaining power of buyers
4. The bargaining power of suppliers
5. Rivalry among existing firms

Analyzing these forces and their effect on the organization helps managers better understand their company's position in the industry to create strategies to build a competitive edge.

Let's take a look at each of the five forces:

1. The threat of new entrants into the market. The strength of this threat depends on how difficult it is for new companies to enter the market. In the insurance industry, insurers who invest in technology to automate processes reduce their costs per policy they write. This reduction in costs makes it possible for the insurer to reduce its premiums, which makes it harder for a new insurer to enter the market. Other barriers to competitors entering the market include the established insurer's long-standing relationships with producers, state and regulatory policy, and the costs involved with establishing an office in a new market.

2. The threat of substitute products or services. This threat arises when products that are capable of performing the same function as those from another industry become widely available. In the insurance industry, the threat of substitute products or services has been limited thus far. One example is alternative methods for transferring risk, such as self-insured retention, formation of captive insurance companies, catastrophe bonds, and finite risk transfer.

3. The bargaining power of buyers. This can increase competition within the industry and lead to lower pricing. The bargaining power of buyers has the biggest impact on the personal insurance market, due to customers pressuring insurers to lower prices and increase availability.

4. The bargaining power of suppliers. In some industries, suppliers can exert great power over companies by increasing their prices, restricting supply, or varying product quality. In the insurance industry, reinsurers act as suppliers to primary insurers. Without reinsurance, many insurers would not be able to write certain types and amounts of insurance.

5. Rivalry among existing companies. Rivalry leads to pricing wars, aggressive ad campaigns, and increased emphasis on customer service. This rivalry is exacerbated where there are many companies, little product differentiation, or high exit costs--all characteristics that you find in the insurance industry. Although some insurers use economies of scale to gain a competitive edge by reducing their expenses, the individual market share of insurers at the top of the market is still relatively small compared to that of other industries. No insurer dominates the overall property-casualty market.

**Apply Your Knowledge**

What are some potential barriers to market entry?

*Feedback*

One potential barrier to market entry involves economies of scale, through which the unit cost of products decreases as volume increases. For example, insurers with an established client base have lower marketing costs and can maintain lower premium rates. Other barriers can include difficulty in forming relationships as strong as those of established competitors and, in some cases, state regulations that make it difficult for new entrants to get a foothold in a market.

**SWOT Analysis**

A SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats) analysis, or situational analysis, is another method insurers use to analyze the competitive environment. Devised by Albert S. Humphrey, a business scholar and management consultant who specialized in business planning and change, SWOT analysis helps organizations consider both the general and task environments.

**Strengths and Weaknesses**

Identifying internal strengths and weaknesses involves considering financial, physical, human, and insurer assets. SWOT analyses help managers determine the current state of their companies by considering assets such as:

- Managerial expertise
- Available product lines
- Staff skill levels and competencies
- Current strategies
- Customer loyalty
- Growth levels
- Organizational structure
- Distribution channels

For example, an insurer would consider the loss of premium volume that could result from cutting prices to gain market share to be a substantial weakness if an unanticipated rise in covered losses is projected as part of the SWOT analysis. But an executive training program known as an industry standard could be a strength.

**Opportunities and Threats**

Insurers can identify potential opportunities or threats by analyzing the external environment, including both general and task environment factors. Trend analysis achieves this by identifying patterns related to specific factors in the past and then projecting those patterns into the future to determine potential threats or opportunities.

For example, insurers might project various demographic trends to reveal new marketing opportunities or a shrinking market for an existing core product.

[b]Performing a SWOT Analysis[/b]

One technique you can use to analyze an organization is to conduct a strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats analysis, or as it's commonly known, a SWOT analysis.

To perform a SWOT analysis you use a table in which each quadrant is labeled strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. Notice that strengths and weaknesses are identified as internal, because these are attributes of the organization itself. Likewise, opportunities and threats are identified as external, because these are factors that come from outside the organization.

You'll find that you can pair the strengths and opportunities together to identify the organization's areas of competitive advantage. Conversely, pairing the organization's weaknesses with its threats helps you identify its risks to avoid.

An insurer's SWOT approach will vary based on its specific needs. Besides identifying strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats, insurers should thoroughly analyze how each affects the strategic plan.

After the insurer completes the SWOT analysis, managers can develop strategies to gain a competitive advantage. They can leverage the insurer's strengths and offset or reduce weaknesses, as well as find ways to capitalize on identified opportunities and neutralize existing threats.

**Apply Your Knowledge**

What are some opportunities and threats an insurer might face?

*Feedback*

Opportunities an insurer might face could be presented by new markets, possible acquisition targets, or reduced competition, while threats might include new competitors, increased competition levels, economic downturns, or changes in customer preferences.

**Summary**

Insurers can use the Five Forces Model to thoroughly assess their external environment by identifying factors related to customers, competitors, and suppliers. Insurers can then use a SWOT analysis to determine internal strengths and weaknesses related to their financial, physical, human, and organizational assets. An examination of the external environment can determine opportunities and threats.

**Glossary**

Five Forces Model: A method of evaluating the external environment in which a company operates. Involves assessing five forces that drive competition: threat of new entrants, threat of substitute products or services, bargaining power of buyers, bargaining power of suppliers, and rivalry among existing firms.

SWOT analysis: A method of evaluating the internal and external environments by assessing an organization's internal strengths and weaknesses and its external opportunities and threats.

"Strategic Decision Making","CPCU 500","2550","# How Strategy Develops Internally

[color=blue]
[url=https://learning.theinstitutes.org/mod/scorm/player.php?a=41671&currentorg=TOC1&scoid=83396]How Strategy Develops Internally[/url][/color]

**Objective**

Analyze strategies developed at the corporate, business, functional, and operational levels.

There are four levels at which an insurer may carry out its strategic plan: corporate, business, functional, and operational.

Strategic plans can be categorized based on the levels at which they are carried out within the insurer, how they relate to its development stage and how they align with the insurer's overall business approach. Let's explore how each level benefits an insurer.

**Types of Organizational Strategies**

While there are several types of strategies, four are more prevalent than others.

Corporate-level strategy is the highest strategy level in a diversified organization. This is where the types of business or activities the organization will undertake are determined and where expectations for profitability are set.

Just below the corporate-level strategy is business-level strategy, which is implemented by a single operation or, in the case of a diversified corporation, a single business unit. At this level, managers develop strategies to support the corporate-level strategy to be competitive in their market and to respond to any changes in the external environment.

Functional-level strategies are carried out by individual departments that perform specific organizational functions, such as marketing or underwriting.

Operational-level strategy relates to a department's narrowly defined day-to-day business activities, such as workflows, production processes, and managing inventory.

**Corporate-Level Strategy**

At the corporate level, an insurer's executive team allocates organizational resources properly and coordinates strategies throughout the company to maximize profits. Corporate-level strategies are relatively long term, established for five-year periods or more.

Competitive advantage is reinforced when each department or unit creates value for the customer. An insurer's marketing, underwriting, claims, and other departments must align to build value and support corporate-level strategy in a continuous chain. This alignment can also provide such advantages as reduced operating expenses or increased product differentiation.

Insurers in growth mode can adopt single business, vertical integration, or diversification strategies. Organizations in decline mode follow bankruptcy, turnaround, divestiture, or harvest strategies.

**Single Business**

By concentrating its efforts and resources on one industry, product, or market, an insurer can build distinctive competencies and gain a competitive advantage. 

Many property-casualty insurers pursue a single-business strategy, even though they write many types of insurance. Potential disadvantages to this approach relate largely to missing opportunities to build a competitive advantage through either vertical integration or diversification.

**Vertical Integration**

A vertical integration strategy can be either backward or forward. 

Through backward integration, an insurer produces its own inputs—for example, printing policy forms in-house instead of purchasing them from a printing supplier. Through forward integration, it sells products directly to customers. Direct writer insurers use this approach. 

Vertical integration can decrease expenses and increase efficiency. But, depending on level of expertise or cost of resources at different stages of the production process, this approach can actually increase costs.

**Diversification**

In pursuit of diversification, insurers use either related or unrelated diversification strategies. 

To understand each type, consider an insurer that writes policies for properties in an area prone to high winds and flooding. To offset potential losses caused by such severe weather, the insurer may wish to diversify by expanding into areas with more predictable, stable weather patterns (related) or into lines of insurance that are unaffected by weather (unrelated).

**The Two Types of Diversification**

A diversification strategy is considered related if a company expands its operation into similar areas. This allows companies to gain economies of scope while sharing resources, such as distribution systems or research and development facilities.

For example, a property-casualty insurer may also provide life or health insurance, thus utilizing its existing technology and agency system to grow its business while distributing risk.

Conversely, an unrelated diversification strategy expands an insurer's operations into areas that have no relation to its existing operations. This is riskier than related diversification because it requires additional costs to coordinate the divergent businesses, results in lost synergy among business units, and involves diminishing returns as economies of scale or scope are likely minimal at best.

For example, if the property-casualty insurer purchased a tax services company, it would not be able to combine production lines. As a result, production costs would not be minimized in the same way they might be if the insurer had purchased a life and health insurance provider instead.

**Decline Mode Strategies**

When an insurer encounters substantial marketplace obstacles or faces numerous internal weaknesses and external threats, such as decreasing profits or loss of market share, it may shift into a decline mode. Corporate-level strategies then become defensive. 

In the worst-case scenario, the organization might determine that the only option is bankruptcy or liquidation. If pursuing bankruptcy, the organization seeks court protection from creditors to reorganize and improve its financial standing. If it cannot recover, however, it is liquidated, and any remaining proceeds are used to pay outstanding obligations.

Another option for insurers in decline is turnaround, in which the organization attempts to rebuild its resources and return to profitability.

If your organization is vertically integrated, does it use a forward or backward integration strategy?

When an organization pursues a vertical integration strategy, it either produces its own inputs that eventually become a product (such as growing its own ingredients for food products), which is referred to as backward integration, or sells its products directly to its customers, which is known as forward integration.

**Business-Level Strategy**

Business-level strategies are developed by managers who support the corporate-level strategy. 

Business-level management responds to changes in the external environment, budgets for needed resources, and coordinates the functional-level strategy within the division. Set for three-to-five-year windows, business-level strategies, sometimes referred to as tactical strategies, come in the form of cost leadership, differentiation, and focus.

**Cost Leadership**

Cost leadership involves eliminating costs of production so that even when prices for similar products are comparable, the cost leader can earn higher overall profits than its competitors. 

For insurers, price cutting might be limited by regulatory constraints. However, insurers can decrease other costs by reducing acquisition expenses through lower commissions for producers, using a direct writer system for some or all of their marketing, and exploring alternative distribution channels. Loss expenses can be reduced by streamlining claims adjusting processes, managing litigation expenses, and implementing cost-containment practices. Underwriting expenses can be reduced by using expert computer systems and standardizing underwriting guidelines. 

**Differentiation**

A successful differentiation strategy focuses on providing products and services that customers perceive as distinctive and that are difficult for rivals to imitate. Insurers that use this strategy may offer special programs for commercial or homeowners insurance, for example.

How might an insurer follow a differentiation strategy?

*Feedback*

If an insurer writes only homeowners or personal auto insurance but targets multiple markets (such as teachers, retired persons, and military personnel), it is following a differentiation strategy.

**Focus**

A focus strategy involves concentrating on a group of customers, a geographic area, or a narrow line of products or services while using a low-cost approach or a differentiation strategy. An example of this is an insurer that offers a wide range of specialized coverages, but only to municipalities. 

Two types of focus strategy are focused cost leadership strategy and focused differentiation strategy. An example of the focused cost leadership approach is when an insurer sells to a specific group of customers, such as retail hardware stores, and offers discounted commercial packages or automobile policies using standard forms. Focused differentiation, meanwhile, can be seen in niche marketing programs, which offer tailored coverages (as opposed to standard forms) to specific groups of customers. 

**Functional-Level Strategy**

Functional-level strategies are the plans for managing a particular functional area, such as finance, marketing, and claims. In insurance operations, functional-level strategies specify how the underwriting, claims, actuarial, and other departments advance business-level strategies. 

For example, if an insurer wants to gain market share by using a cost leadership strategy, it must become a highly efficient organization. Its Human Resources Department may be charged with researching ways to improve efficiency by realigning the insurer's workforce, while the Information Technology Department looks to lower overall production costs and improve the speed of organizational communications. 

Likewise, an insurer that's pursuing a differentiation strategy would consider innovation and quality at all functional levels to be critical to providing a distinctive product that meets customers' needs.

**Operational-Level Strategy**

Operational-level strategies involve daily business processes and workflows and are implemented within individual departments to support the strategies of the functional, business, and corporate levels. 

For example, a claims office with a high volume of claims and a functional-level strategy to improve efficiency might request more information at the time a claim is reported in order to eliminate redundant communication with insureds. A premium auditing department, striving to achieve a functional-level budget strategy, might use pre-audit screening as an operational-level strategy to make the most effective use of resources to achieve its budget goals.

Millstone Insurance Company is facing several internal and external challenges in its business operation. Because of a competitive employment market, the insurer has struggled to maintain staffing levels and is having difficulty staffing its headquarters location. In addition to this office, Millstone has three regional offices throughout the Midwest and Northeast. 

Because of heavy competition in the types of insurance it writes, Millstone has lost considerable market share in most of its territories and has experienced steadily decreasing profits. What corporate-level strategies might Millstone's management team evaluate?

*Feedback*

Millstone is struggling and currently operating in a decline mode. Alternatives available to corporate management include following a harvest strategy to gain short-term profits while phasing out a particular product line or exiting the market. If management determined that the company should be reorganized in an effort to return to profitability, it would follow a turnaround strategy. If, however, it decided the best approach were to sell off a portion of its business, it would follow a divestiture strategy. State regulators in each jurisdiction would, of course, affect the decision that managers would make, with the alternatives available to an insurance operation differing from those available to a noninsurance operation.

**Summary**

Strategy is planned and implemented at an insurer's corporate, business, functional, and operational levels. Corporate-level strategies are developed by the executive team. Business-level strategies are employed by divisional managers within the insurer. Functional areas of insurers include marketing, underwriting, claims, risk control, premium audit, actuarial, and finance. Operational-level strategies are implemented within individual departments to support the strategies of the functional, business, and corporate levels; these strategies focus on daily business operations.

**Objective**

Given information about an insurer's business strategies, conduct a SWOT analysis of its strategy.

The best way to evaluate an insurer's strategies is to use information about the insurer's strategic goals and internal and external environments, which can be provided by a SWOT analysis (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats). Understanding the benefits of each stage of this analysis helps insurance professionals plan for opportunities and threats as they arise.

Because SWOT analysis results, much like the environments they examine, can change over time, insurers should conduct the analysis periodically. Doing so will help them evaluate their strategies and, if needed, adjust their goals and objectives. 

Let's apply this process to environmental factors faced by one insurer.

**Greenly Insurance Company—Internal and External Environment**

Greenly Insurance Company is a 60-year-old regional mutual insurance company authorized and operating in 8 states. The company is headquartered in Pennsylvania, but maintains at least one satellite claims office in each state in which it writes. Greenly writes only personal lines risks, with automobile insurance being the core of its business.

Auto customers may be offered coverage from Greenly's preferred automobile insurance company or in its nonstandard, high-risk company. The company offers generous discounts for drivers between the ages of 35 and 60, based on the group's favorable loss ratios. Greenly does not offer a rating discount based on longevity, although long-term households also show consistently favorable loss ratios.

The company's operations are consistent with the core values it established 60 years ago: to protect policyholders' assets, gain customer loyalty, be a good corporate citizen, and comply with all legal requirements. Throughout its existence, the company has enjoyed a consistently superior financial rating. A conservative investment strategy, favorable underwriting results, and conservative policy growth have allowed Greenly to maintain ample policyholders' surplus, even in years of high-catastrophe losses and lackluster returns on investments.

Greenly does not compete based on price, but rather on financial strength and core values. Greenly uses independent agents to sell its products, and a monthly policyholder magazine accounts for the majority of its advertising. Greenly's customer-focused philosophy stresses personalized service to gain customer trust and loyalty. Therefore, Greenly's website does not provide quotes, direct purchase options, claims reporting, or premium payment options.

Over the past decade, the automobile insurance market has changed dramatically. Policyholders demand customer service, yet also want lower premiums. The line between preferred and nonstandard has blurred, as credit-based insurance scoring and other predictive tools have resulted in more refined pricing. And increased use of rating tiers, more sophisticated coverage, and rating options mean that insurers are able to rate and compete for segments of business that they may not have in the past.

**Greenly's Goals and Current Results**

Greenly's goals, which have remained consistent for many years, should determine its business strategies. 

Although Greenly has developed business strategies based on these goals, it has failed to meet its automobile insurance written premium and policy growth goals for the past two years. Even more concerning, new business has declined steadily over the same time period, with retention ratios of existing business decreasing at an even greater pace.  

A survey of Greenly's agents reveals that the children of Greenly's insureds are less likely to stay with Greenly when they establish their own households. Many cited dissatisfaction with claims service as a primary reason for obtaining coverage elsewhere, despite post-claim surveys that show acceptable results.

Some automobile insurers invest millions of dollars annually in high-profile advertising. Celebrity spokespersons, mascots, special effects, and humor have led to name recognition for certain companies and remind consumers that they can easily switch insurers. Generally, younger consumers tend to seek information from insurers' websites or apps when shopping for automobile insurance.

**Greenly's SWOT Analysis**

Evaluating an organization's strategies involves a series of decision-making steps that focus on an insurer's issues, strategies, and desired outcomes. Although you can determine an insurer's strengths and weaknesses according to subjective criteria, the overall process allows for an objective view of the environments in which the insurer operates. 

Greenly's SWOT analysis reveals that the company faces a high-risk threat because it hasn't kept pace with the needs of existing customers or the buying preferences of prospective customers. Customer satisfaction surveys can be unreliable because they're outdated and don't ask the right questions or reach a broad enough audience. And Greenly's monthly magazine, its traditional way of directly communicating with policyholders, may have little impact on customer relations or loyalty. 

Reviewing both the survey questions and the target audience may reveal whether Greenly needs to revise the survey process. For example, responses could be skewed toward positive results if the insurer is relying only on input from current satisfied customers rather than from former customers who may have left because of dissatisfaction. 

**Determining Which Business Strategies to Evaluate**

An organization's business strategies are its long-term approach to reaching its goals and objectives. Because these strategies can be extensive, it's helpful to understand the business issue that prompted the evaluation, which can help target and evaluate relevant strategies.

**Check Your Understanding**

Which business strategies have contributed to Greenly's failure to meet its customer satisfaction and loyalty goals and policy growth target?

*Feedback*

Let's assume that customers are leaving because they are dissatisfied with Greenly's products, services, or prices. If so, the company may need to reevaluate its customer-focused strategy because its current goal of meeting customer needs fails to address the need to identify changes in the marketplace. The company's business strategies also lack commitment to respond to insurance consumers' changing habits and expectations.

**Evaluating Relevant Business Strategies**

After an organization examines its internal and external environments and its business strategies, the next step is to figure out whether it needs to change course to achieve its goals. 

**Check Your Understanding**

Will Greenly's current business strategies continue to help Greenly reach its goals, or should the company change course?

*Feedback*

The SWOT analysis indicates that Greenly has not adequately identified or kept pace with its customers' changing expectations. Using that information to evaluate its business strategies, Greenly will have to revise its customer-focused strategy to meet its goals. As a well-capitalized company, Greenly is in a good position to implement changes, such as updating technology and designing marketing programs to attract and retain business.

Greenly's current customer-focused strategy won't achieve its growth goals. The insurer has committed to customer satisfaction but has not devised an effective way to determine customer needs and opinions. 

Although Greenly is committed to asking for feedback through renewal and post-claim surveys, those surveys may not be worded in a way that invites the type of feedback needed for it to truly evaluate its operations. For example, if the surveys only solicit feedback on current issues, Greenly won't hear how customers believe the company has changed, improved, or even declined over time—or hear suggestions for the future. Perhaps even more importantly, Greenly has no established method of seeking input from former customers on why they left.

If the insurer revises its customer surveys and shows added methods of reaching out to current and former customers and agents, it may find that additional changes are needed, too. For example, based on this input, Greenly may revise its business strategies to include opportunities to attract and retain policyholders and help meet the company's goals. 

**Check Your Understanding**

What are some ways Greenly could change its processes to attract and retain policyholders?

*Feedback*

Some ways Greenly could attract and retain policyholders include:

- Redesigning its website to add an online quote capability or other interactive options
- Expanding into a new state as a direct writer
- Implementing a pilot program to test new products or coverage options
- Redesigning the company magazine to emphasize new developments and target second-generation policyholders
- Refocusing community involvement efforts on issues appealing to second-generation policyholders and effectively promoting those efforts
- Retraining claims staff to improve customer satisfaction

**Summary**

A SWOT analysis is a structured examination of an organization's internal and external environments, conducted as a prelude to action planning. When used to evaluate an organization's business strategies, the SWOT analysis focuses on the event that prompted the evaluation. The organization then examines the results of the business strategies relevant to the cause of the event to decide whether those strategies will continue to be effective in achieving its goals.
