I am having a problem where the card flip animation doesn't work automatically in my Flutter WebView when users answer questions incorrectly. Here's exactly what I
  need fixed:

  The Expected Behavior (Confirm This First)

  Before making any changes, verify you understand the correct workflow:

  1. When user answers CORRECTLY:
    - Show green "Correct!" feedback
    - Show "Get Help" button
    - Card should NOT auto-flip
    - Only flip to show chatbot if user manually clicks "Get Help"
  2. When user answers INCORRECTLY:
    - Show red "Incorrect" feedback
    - Card MUST automatically flip after 1.5 seconds
    - Show AI chatbot or static explanation on the back
    - This auto-flip currently works in Chrome/Safari but NOT in Flutter WebView

  The Problem to Identify

  First, identify these facts in the code at client/src/components/question-card.tsx:

  1. Line 148-236: There's a useEffect hook that tries to handle auto-flip for Flutter WebView when it detects question.userAnswer.isCorrect === false
  2. Lines 163-233: Inside that useEffect, there's complex logic with MutationObserver and polling that never executes
  3. Lines 258-296: There's a separate useEffect for regular browsers that DOES work
  4. Line 340 (handleShowChatbot): The manual "Get Help" button works perfectly in Flutter WebView
  5. The root cause: React's useEffect hooks don't execute in Flutter WebView because the JavaScript engine doesn't process the microtask queue after rendering. The
  component re-renders (incorrect feedback appears on screen), but the effect callbacks never run.

  The Exact Fix

  Replace the broken useEffect approach with a ref callback that executes synchronously during React's commit phase. Here's what to do:

  Step 1: Find the incorrect feedback div (around line 629-636)

  Look for this code:
  {isCorrect === false && (
    <div className="p-3 bg-red-50 dark:bg-red-900/20 border border-red-200 dark:border-red-800 rounded-lg">
      <div className="flex items-center">
        <XCircle className="h-4 w-4 text-error mr-2" />
        <span className="font-medium text-error text-sm">Incorrect</span>
      </div>
    </div>
  )}

  Step 2: Add a ref callback to that div

  Modify it to include a ref attribute that triggers the flip for WebView:

  {isCorrect === false && (
    <div 
      ref={(node) => {
        // Ref callbacks execute synchronously during commit phase (works in Flutter WebView!)
        if (node && isWebView() && !hasAutoFlipped) {
          console.log('[WebView Ref Callback] Incorrect feedback mounted, scheduling flip');

          // Use setTimeout (macrotask) instead of relying on useEffect (microtask)
          // This works because Flutter WebView processes macrotasks reliably
          const timerId = setTimeout(() => {
            console.log('[WebView Ref Callback] Executing flip now');
            setIsFlipped(true);
            setHasAutoFlipped(true);
          }, 1500); // 1.5 second delay to match browser behavior

          // Store timer ID so we can clean it up if component unmounts
          (window as any).webViewFlipTimer = timerId;
        }
      }}
      className="p-3 bg-red-50 dark:bg-red-900/20 border border-red-200 dark:border-red-800 rounded-lg"
    >
      <div className="flex items-center">
        <XCircle className="h-4 w-4 text-error mr-2" />
        <span className="font-medium text-error text-sm">Incorrect</span>
      </div>
    </div>
  )}

  Step 3: Clean up the timer in the cleanup useEffect

  Find the useEffect that runs on question change (around lines 110-146). In the cleanup section at the top, add cleanup for the new timer:

  useEffect(() => {
    // Clean up any existing intervals/timers/observers
    if ((window as any).flipInterval) {
      window.clearInterval((window as any).flipInterval);
      (window as any).flipInterval = null;
    }
    if ((window as any).flipObserver) {
      (window as any).flipObserver.disconnect();
      (window as any).flipObserver = null;
    }
    // ADD THIS NEW CLEANUP:
    if ((window as any).webViewFlipTimer) {
      window.clearTimeout((window as any).webViewFlipTimer);
      (window as any).webViewFlipTimer = null;
    }

    // ... rest of the useEffect
  }, [question?.id, onFlipChange]);

  Step 4: Remove or comment out the broken WebView logic

  In the useEffect at lines 148-236, find the section that starts with:
  // IMMEDIATE AUTO-FLIP FOR INCORRECT ANSWERS IN WEBVIEW
  // Trigger flip directly here instead of in separate useEffect
  if (question.userAnswer.isCorrect === false && !isFlipped && !hasAutoFlipped && isWebView()) {

  Comment out or delete lines 163-233 (the entire WebView-specific flip logic inside that useEffect). Replace it with a simple comment:

  // WEBVIEW AUTO-FLIP: Now handled via ref callback on incorrect feedback div
  // See the ref callback around line 630 for the working implementation
  if (question.userAnswer.isCorrect === false && !isFlipped && !hasAutoFlipped && isWebView()) {
    console.log('[WebView] Incorrect answer detected - flip handled by ref callback');
  }

  Why This Works

  The fix works because:

  1. Ref callbacks execute synchronously during React's commit phase, not in the microtask queue
  2. setTimeout creates a macrotask which Flutter WebView processes reliably (unlike microtasks)
  3. Bypasses the broken useEffect entirely - no dependency on microtask queue
  4. Maintains the same UX - 1.5 second delay matches browser behavior
  5. Only affects incorrect answers - correct answers still work as before

  Testing Checklist

  After applying the fix, test these scenarios in Flutter WebView:

  - User answers correctly → No auto-flip, "Get Help" button works manually
  - User answers incorrectly → Card auto-flips after 1.5 seconds, shows chatbot/static explanation
  - Console shows logs: [WebView Ref Callback] Incorrect feedback mounted, scheduling flip then [WebView Ref Callback] Executing flip now
  - Switching to next question cleans up timer properly (no memory leaks)
  - Still works correctly in Chrome/Safari browsers (don't break existing functionality)

  This fix specifically targets the Flutter WebView microtask queue starvation issue while preserving all existing behavior in standard browsers.
