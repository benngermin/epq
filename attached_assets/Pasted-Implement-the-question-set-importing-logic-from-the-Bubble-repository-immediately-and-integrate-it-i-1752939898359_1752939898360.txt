Implement the question set importing logic from the Bubble repository immediately and integrate it into the existing admin page. Add functionality to fetch and import question sets exclusively from ti-content-repository.bubbleapps.io, as it holds the complete repository for question sets. Ensure the admin page remains available on its dedicated URL (e.g., /admin), and is only accessible by authenticated Admin users (implement or verify role-based access control, checking user roles before rendering or processing requests on this page).

Refresh or populate the local database by querying and importing:

All Question Sets (slug: question_set)
Use the Data API base URL: https://ti-content-repository.bubbleapps.io/version-test/api/1.1/obj

Authenticate all requests with Bearer token using the API key from environment variable BUBBLE_API_KEY (ensure this is set in the environment).

Query all question sets via:
GET https://ti-content-repository.bubbleapps.io/version-test/api/1.1/obj/question_set
Fields: Include custom fields like user (User reference), learning_object (Learning Object reference), or others as defined; plus standard fields: Creator (User), Modified Date (date), Created Date (date), Slug (text). Ensure full question data (e.g., JSON structures or text) is fetched and stored without truncation.

Implement this updated flow now as an additional option on the admin page:

On the admin page, add a button or endpoint to trigger fetching question sets, with an input field for course number to optionally filter the import; store or overwrite the fetched data in the local DB (create tables if needed, e.g., for question_set with complete fields).
All filtering of question sets should be done by course number; if a course number is provided, use constraints like [{"key": "learning_object.course.course_number", "constraint_type": "equals", "value": "<course_number>"}], but fetch all if no filter is specified.
Disable any fallbacks to hardcoded or offline cached data; always use fresh API pulls.
After implementation, log sample updated DB records (e.g., full details for several question sets) to confirm, and display import status or results on the admin page for Admin users.
