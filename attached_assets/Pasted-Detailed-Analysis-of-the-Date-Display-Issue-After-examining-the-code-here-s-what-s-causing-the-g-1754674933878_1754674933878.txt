Detailed Analysis of the Date Display Issue

  After examining the code, here's what's causing the graphs to show August 7th instead of August 8th:

  Root Cause

  The issue is in the getTodayEST() function in /server/utils/logger.ts:40-81. This function is supposed to return today's date at midnight in Eastern Time, but it has a critical bug in how it
  constructs the UTC timestamp.

  The Bug

  When the function calculates midnight Eastern Time and converts it to UTC, it incorrectly constructs the date string:
  return new Date(`${easternDateStr}T0${offsetHours}:00:00.000Z`);

  This creates dates like:
  - 2025-08-08T04:00:00.000Z (for EDT, offset 4 hours)
  - 2025-08-08T05:00:00.000Z (for EST, offset 5 hours)

  The Problem: These timestamps represent 4 AM or 5 AM UTC on August 8th, which is actually midnight on August 8th Eastern Time. However, the SQL queries in the database are comparing against
  dates in Eastern Time, causing a mismatch.

  How It Affects the Graphs

  1. Data Generation: In storage.ts:1102-1250 (getQuestionSetUsageByDate) and storage.ts:1295-1443 (getQuestionsAnsweredByDate), the functions use getTodayEST() to determine the date range for
  the graphs.
  2. SQL Date Series: The SQL queries generate a date series that should end with "today" but because of the timezone offset bug, the series ends one day early:
  SELECT generate_series(
    DATE(startDate AT TIME ZONE 'UTC' AT TIME ZONE 'America/New_York'),
    DATE(NOW() AT TIME ZONE 'America/New_York'),  -- This should be Aug 8
    '1 day'::interval
  )
  3. Frontend Display: The React component (app-logs-section.tsx:192-237) correctly formats the dates it receives, but it's receiving dates that end on August 7th instead of August 8th because
  the backend is sending the wrong date range.

  Why It's Off by One Day

  The timezone conversion is adding the offset hours to the hour field instead of properly converting Eastern midnight to its UTC equivalent. For EDT (UTC-4):
  - Correct: August 8 midnight ET = August 8 04:00 UTC (same day)
  - Current Bug: Creates August 8 04:00 UTC but treats it as if it's August 7

  The bug essentially causes the system to think "today" is yesterday, which is why your graphs show August 7th as the most recent date when today is actually August 8th.

  Additional Issue

  The same bug exists in getDateAtMidnightEST() function (lines 84-114), which would affect any date conversions, not just "today".
