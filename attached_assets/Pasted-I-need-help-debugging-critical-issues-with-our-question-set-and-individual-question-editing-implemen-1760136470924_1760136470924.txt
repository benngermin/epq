I need help debugging critical issues with our question set and individual question editing implementation. Below are specific problems requiring investigation:

## CRITICAL BUGS

### 1. Multiple Choice Answer Editing - Completely Broken
**Current broken behavior:**
1. Click answer option to edit
2. Attempt to type in text box
3. Immediately ejected from text box (save button overrides editing)
4. Cannot re-enter ANY answer option text boxes (correct or incorrect)

**Expected behavior:**
- Click answer option → edit text freely → click Save → confirm via modal
- Changes display immediately on frontend but only write to database after Save + confirmation
- No character-by-character confirmation needed

**Status:** Cannot edit multiple choice answer text AT ALL.

### 2. Select From List - Correct Answer Selection Broken
**Current broken behavior:**
1. Open advanced settings
2. Select correct answer dropdown
3. Choose new correct answer
4. Nothing happens - no change reflected
5. Save button appears but no actual modification occurs

**Expected behavior:**
- Selection changes immediately on frontend
- Save button writes to database only after confirmation modal
- Display must reflect the new selection before save

### 3. "Add Answer Option" Button - Remove Entirely
**Reason:** JSON schema restricts multiple choice, select from list, and multiple response questions to exactly 4 answer options. Remove "Add answer option" button from these three question types.

### 4. "Add Acceptable Answer" Button - Non-Functional
**Current broken behavior:**
- Button click does nothing - no new entry added

**Expected behavior:**
1. Click "Add acceptable answer"
2. New entry appears in acceptable answer list
3. Enter text value
4. Select case sensitivity checkbox
5. Click Save + confirm to write to database
6. Frontend displays changes immediately; database writes only after confirmation

**Note:** Unlike answer options, acceptable answers are UNLIMITED.

## STATIC EXPLANATION GENERATION - VERIFICATION REQUIRED

Meticulously verify the static explanation workflow:

1. **Content Repository API call:** Confirm request succeeds and content retrieves correctly
2. **OpenRouter API call:** Verify the user message contains the prompt with ALL variables properly replaced

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT:** Whatever prompt I save in the static explanation prompt textbox MUST be used in the OpenRouter API call. No exceptions.
- Edits to the prompt → must reflect in API call
- Model changes → must reflect in API call
- NO hardcoded prompts
- NO fallback prompts
- Use EXACTLY what I save

## ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION

### Question Versioning Hypothesis
Our legacy question versioning system was complex and convoluted (multiple versions per question, etc.). **I suspect this is causing the editing panel bugs.**

**Verify the following:**
1. Admin panel displays the ONE TRUE VALUE for each question field
2. Frontend users see the same ONE TRUE VALUE
3. Question sets are composed of unique combinations of ONE TRUE VALUE questions
4. No version confusion anywhere in the editing flow

## DEBUGGING APPROACH

For each issue:
1. Approach from first principles - discard all assumptions
2. When confused, READ THE CODE carefully
3. Understand component connections and data flow
4. Trace why functionality is failing
5. Verify expected behavior against actual implementation

Investigate methodically and report findings for each numbered issue.
