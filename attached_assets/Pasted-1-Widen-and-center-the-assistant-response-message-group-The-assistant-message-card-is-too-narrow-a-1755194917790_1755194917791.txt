1) Widen and center the assistant response/message group

The assistant message card is too narrow and looks off-center because the right gutter is larger than the left. Make the message group use more of the content column and sit perfectly centered.

Use symmetrical left/right gutters in the chat/assistant pane so the card’s right margin matches the left.

Keep the card inside the main content column, but increase its usable width (no cramped right edge). If there’s a hard max-width, raise it so the bubble occupies most of the column on mobile.

Center the card in the column with equal horizontal margins; do not change typography, shadows, or internal spacing—this is only a width/alignment fix.

Acceptance: on mobile, the assistant bubble looks visually centered with equal gutters on both sides and clearly takes more horizontal space than it does now.

2) Fix “Submit Answer” being untappable when choices require scrolling

On mobile, when a question’s choices are long enough to scroll, I can scroll to the Submit button but can’t actually tap it. The bottom sticky “Previous / Next” bar (and/or the mobile viewport height math) is blocking the last bit of scroll/tap area.

Remove any nested scrolling that traps the options list; prefer a single scroll context for the page. If an inner scroll container must remain, give that container bottom padding (or margin) equal to the sticky footer height plus the device safe-area inset and a small cushion, so the Submit button can scroll fully above the sticky bar.

Ensure the sticky footer does not overlay and capture taps on the content area. Restrict its hit area to the actual buttons (avoid a full-width invisible overlay), and make sure z-index/stacking doesn’t place it on top of the Submit button.

Audit viewport units on mobile: replace any 100vh height locks with modern dynamic/safe units (100dvh/100svh) or use a min-height approach so iOS Safari’s expanding/collapsing bars don’t shorten the scrollable region.

Keep the layout and elements as they are; this is a scroll/spacing/stacking fix, not a redesign.

Acceptance: on iPhone/Safari with a long list of options, I can scroll so that Submit sits fully above the sticky footer with a small buffer (visibly clear of overlap) and tapping it works reliably. The Previous/Next bar remains visible at all times.
