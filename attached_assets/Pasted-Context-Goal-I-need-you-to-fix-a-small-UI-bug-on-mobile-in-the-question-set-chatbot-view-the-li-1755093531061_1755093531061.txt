Context / Goal

I need you to fix a small UI bug on mobile: in the question-set chatbot view, the light-gray background above the “Progress (x/y)” pill is smaller than the gray below it. The gray areas should be equal. The cause is stacked vertical padding on two adjacent containers that both have the gray background.

What to do (exact edits)

client/src/pages/question-set-practice-optimized.tsx

Make the pill wrapper’s padding symmetric:

diff
Copy
Edit
- <div className="px-4 pt-2 pb-1">
+ <div className="px-4 py-2">
Remove the extra mobile top padding from the main content directly under the pill, but keep desktop spacing:

diff
Copy
Edit
- <div className="flex-1 p-4 overflow-hidden">
+ <div className="flex-1 overflow-hidden px-4 pt-0 pb-4 lg:p-4">
(If the gray background is on this container, keep it; the key is pt-0 until lg:.)

client/src/pages/question-set-practice.tsx (non-optimized variant mirrors the same issue)

Symmetric padding for the pill wrapper:

diff
Copy
Edit
- <div className="lg:hidden px-4 pt-3 pb-1.5">
+ <div className="lg:hidden px-4 py-2">
Remove extra mobile top padding on the next container; preserve larger desktop spacing:

diff
Copy
Edit
- <div className="flex-1 min-w-0 flex flex-col h-full p-2 sm:p-3 md:p-4">
+ <div className="flex-1 min-w-0 flex flex-col h-full overflow-hidden px-2 sm:px-3 md:px-4 pt-0 sm:pt-3 md:pt-4 pb-4">
Why this fixes it

Currently the big gray area below the pill = the pill wrapper’s bottom padding plus the next section’s top padding. Setting the next section to pt-0 on mobile makes the gray above and below come only from the pill wrapper’s py-2, so they match. Desktop spacing is unchanged via the lg: classes.

QA / Acceptance

On ~375px width, the gray above and below “Progress (x/y)” are visually equal.

Opening/closing the progress drawer does not change the spacing.

At lg and up, spacing matches the current desktop layout.

If anything still looks off

Temporarily add rings to confirm where padding remains on mobile:

jsx
Copy
Edit
<div className="lg:hidden bg-muted/40 px-4 py-2 ring-1 ring-red-500">…</div>
<div className="flex-1 flex overflow-hidden bg-muted/40 ring-1 ring-blue-500">
  <div className="flex-1 overflow-hidden px-4 pt-0 pb-4 lg:p-4 ring-1 ring-green-500">…</div>
</div>
The blue/green blocks should show no mobile top padding (pt-0).
