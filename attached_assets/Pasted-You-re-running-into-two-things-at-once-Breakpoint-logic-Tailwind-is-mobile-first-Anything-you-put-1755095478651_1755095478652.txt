You’re running into two things at once:

Breakpoint logic
Tailwind is mobile-first. Anything you put behind md: won’t apply at 430px. If your base (no prefix) still contains truncate/whitespace-nowrap, those will win on phones no matter what you try at md:.

A hidden truncate chain
The ellipsis (“CPCU 50…”) means somewhere on the title or an ancestor you still have some combo of:
truncate → sets overflow-hidden text-ellipsis whitespace-nowrap.
Even if you add whitespace-normal later, the earlier truncate (or a parent with whitespace-nowrap) keeps forcing a single line.

Do this (exact, minimal fix)
In the header that shows the course title + “Question Set 1” select:

tsx
Copy
Edit
<header className="flex flex-col gap-2 md:flex-row md:items-center md:justify-between">
  <h1
    className="
      block w-full
      text-base md:text-lg font-semibold leading-tight
      whitespace-normal break-words
      md:truncate md:whitespace-nowrap md:text-ellipsis
    "
  >
    {courseTitle}
  </h1>

  <div className="w-full md:w-auto md:ml-auto">
    <QuestionSetSelect ... />
  </div>
</header>
Important removals on mobile (no prefixes):

Remove truncate, text-ellipsis, whitespace-nowrap, and any overflow-hidden from the <h1> and its immediate parent.

Only re-enable truncation at desktop with prefixes: md:truncate md:whitespace-nowrap md:text-ellipsis.

Also check these two spots (common culprits):

A wrapper div around the <h1> that has truncate or whitespace-nowrap. Strip them (or gate behind md:).

Utility like justify-between on the header at mobile can squeeze the title. Use md:justify-between and no justify-between at base (we used gap-2 instead).

You do not need line-clamp for this to work. It’s fine to leave it out entirely unless you want a hard 2-line cap.

Quick verification (takes 30 seconds)
In DevTools on the phone/emulator, select the <h1>.

Computed → white-space must be normal at 430px.

Computed → overflow must not be hidden at 430px.

Temporarily add a debug class to the title: bg-yellow-100. If you still see an ellipsis, there’s still a truncate/nowrap on a parent—walk up the DOM and remove it (or gate it behind md:).

Why your earlier attempts didn’t show up
Moving behavior to md: doesn’t affect 430px (that’s < 768px).

As long as any base or ancestor utility sets whitespace-nowrap/overflow-hidden, the title will keep truncating regardless of your new classes. Removing min-w-0 doesn’t fix that—nowrap is the blocker.
