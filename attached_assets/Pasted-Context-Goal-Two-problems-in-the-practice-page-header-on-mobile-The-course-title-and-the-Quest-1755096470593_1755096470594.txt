Context / Goal

Two problems in the practice page header on mobile:

The course title and the “Question Set” select should stack vertically, but they still sit side-by-side.

The title still shows an ellipsis; we want the full title on mobile and single-line truncate on desktop only.

Please fix both.

What to change (use Grid to force stacking, then clean up truncation)

Replace the header layout with a mobile-first Grid. This guarantees stacking regardless of any stray inline-flex/justify-between classes.

tsx
Copy
Edit
// BEFORE: header uses flex and doesn't stack reliably
// <header className="... flex ...">

// AFTER
<header className="grid grid-cols-1 gap-2 md:grid-cols-[1fr_auto] md:items-center">
  <h1
    className="
      block w-full
      text-base md:text-lg font-semibold leading-tight
      whitespace-normal break-words
      md:truncate md:whitespace-nowrap md:text-ellipsis
    "
    title={courseTitle}
  >
    {courseTitle}
  </h1>

  <div className="w-full md:w-auto md:justify-self-end">
    <QuestionSetSelect ... />
  </div>
</header>
Mobile: grid-cols-1 → title on row 1, dropdown on row 2.

Desktop: md:grid-cols-[1fr_auto] → title left, dropdown right.

Remove any JS string shortening of the title. The ellipsis should not be inserted by code.

Search for and delete any logic like:

truncate(, shortTitle, formatTitle, .slice(...)+ '…', .substring(...) + '…'.

Use the raw title:

tsx
Copy
Edit
const courseTitle = course?.title ?? "";
Strip base-level truncation from the DOM tree.

Ensure no base classes on the <h1> or its parents include truncate, overflow-hidden, or whitespace-nowrap.

Truncation is desktop-only via md:truncate md:whitespace-nowrap md:text-ellipsis.

Acceptance criteria

At ~430px width, the header shows the full title (wrapping as needed) on the first row and the Question Set select on its own row beneath.

At ≥768px, the header returns to a single row with the title on the left, select on the right, and the title truncated to one line if long.

No JS-inserted ellipses remain.

If it still won’t stack

Verify in DevTools that the header is display: grid at 430px and has grid-template-columns: 1fr.

If any ancestor sets display:flex with absolute positioning on the select, remove those at mobile.

As a quick guard, add w-full on the select wrapper (already in the snippet) so it occupies its own row on mobile.
