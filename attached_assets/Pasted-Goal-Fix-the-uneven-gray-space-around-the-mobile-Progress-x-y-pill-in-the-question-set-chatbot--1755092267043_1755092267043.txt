Goal: Fix the uneven gray space around the mobile “Progress (x/y)” pill in the question-set chatbot view. The extra space below the pill comes from stacked padding on two adjacent containers that both use bg-muted/40.

Root cause:

The pill lives in a wrapper with small bottom padding.

The very next section (main content) also has top padding, and it shares the same gray background. Those paddings add up, so the gray area below the pill looks much larger than the gray area above it.

Find the mobile progress wrapper under the comment Mobile Progress Indicator - In Grey Background Area:

- <div className="px-4 pt-2 pb-1">
+ <div className="px-4 py-2">
Reduce the mobile top padding of the main content while preserving desktop spacing:

Edit
- <div className="flex-1 p-4 overflow-hidden">
+ <div className="flex-1 overflow-hidden px-4 pt-2 pb-4 lg:p-4">
client/src/pages/question-set-practice.tsx (non-optimized page mirrors the same pattern)

Make the pill’s wrapper symmetric:

Edit
- <div className="lg:hidden px-4 pt-3 pb-1.5">
+ <div className="lg:hidden px-4 py-2">
Trim the mobile top padding for the right/main content:

diff
Copy
Edit
- <div className="flex-1 min-w-0 flex flex-col h-full p-2 sm:p-3 md:p-4">
+ <div className="flex-1 min-w-0 flex flex-col h-full overflow-hidden px-2 sm:px-3 md:px-4 pt-2 sm:pt-3 md:pt-4 pb-4">
Why this works: The pill’s container now has equal top/bottom spacing, and the next section contributes less top padding on mobile, so the gray above and below the pill visually match. Desktop (lg:) spacing is unchanged.

QA checklist (phone width ~375px):

Gray above and below the Progress pill looks equal.

Tapping the pill to open/close the sidebar doesn’t shift spacing.

At lg and up, spacing remains as before.

Optional alternative (if preferred): Move bg-muted/40 to a single parent and remove it from the other wrapper so only one container owns the gray background. The padding changes above are the smallest safe fix.
