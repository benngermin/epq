I am having deployment failures that are blocking the provision phase. My deployments have been stuck in provision for 16+ hours with no logs. I need you
   to fix the following specific issues that are preventing provision from completing:

  ## PROVISION PHASE BLOCKERS - FIX ALL OF THESE

  ### Issue 1: Excessive Nix Packages Causing Provision Timeout
  **Location**: `.replit` file, line 7
  **Current state**: `packages = ["imagemagick", "jq", "libuuid", "cairo", "pango", "libpng", "libjpeg", "giflib", "librsvg", "pixman", "freetype",
  "fontconfig", "nspr", "nss", "atk", "cups", "libdrm", "libxkbcommon", "xorg.libXcomposite", "xorg.libXdamage", "xorg.libXrandr", "mesa", "alsa-lib",
  "at-spi2-core", "at-spi2-atk", "xorg.libX11", "xorg.libXcursor", "xorg.libXi", "xorg.libXext", "xorg.libXtst", "xorg.libXScrnSaver", "gtk3"]`
  **Problem**: 33 packages are being installed during provision, causing timeout
  **Fix**: Replace the entire packages array with only: `packages = ["imagemagick", "jq", "libuuid"]`

  ### Issue 2: Playwright in Production Dependencies
  **Location**: `package.json`, line 84
  **Current state**: `"playwright": "^1.55.0",` is in the `dependencies` section
  **Problem**: Playwright downloads ~1GB of browser binaries during npm install, exhausting provision time/disk
  **Fix**: Move `"playwright": "^1.55.0",` from `dependencies` to `devDependencies` section (around line 110)

  ### Issue 3: Canvas in Production Dependencies (Unused)
  **Location**: `package.json`, line 56
  **Current state**: `"canvas": "^3.2.0",` is in the `dependencies` section
  **Problem**: Canvas requires native compilation and is not imported anywhere in the codebase
  **Fix**: Delete the line `"canvas": "^3.2.0",` entirely from dependencies

  ### Issue 4: Untracked Replit State Directories
  **Location**: `.gitignore` file
  **Problem**: `.local/` (57MB) and `.config/` directories are not ignored and get uploaded during deployment
  **Fix**: Add these two lines to `.gitignore`:
  .local/
  .config/

  ## EXECUTION ORDER
  Fix these issues in this exact order: Issue 1, Issue 2, Issue 3, Issue 4. After all fixes are complete, I will test deployment.
