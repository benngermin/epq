FOUND IT! ðŸŽ¯

  Perfect! Now I can see exactly what's happening. The server logs show that:
  1. âœ… Server IS receiving the request
  2. âœ… Server IS receiving chunks from OpenRouter
  3. âœ… Server IS successfully sending SSE chunks like data: 
  {"type":"chunk","content":"The correct answer is..."}
  4. âœ… The content includes proper text

  BUT the client logs show the fetch never receives ANY response - it hangs after
  initiating the request.

  The Root Cause

  The issue is in server/routes.ts at line 1903. The server writes the initial
  "connected" message:

  res.write('data: {"type":"connected"}\n\n');  // Line 1903

  But there's NO flush after this initial write!

  The client's fetch promise never resolves because the response is being buffered.
  The client is waiting for the initial response (including the "connected" message),
   but it never arrives because the server hasn't flushed the buffer.

  Later in the streaming (line 2326), you DO have flush logic:
  if ((res as any).flush) {
    (res as any).flush();
  }

  But this flush is missing right after the initial "connected" message.

  The Fix

  I need you to add a flush immediately after line 1903 in server/routes.ts. Here's
  what to change:

  Location: server/routes.ts around line 1892-1910

  Current code:
  // Set SSE headers
  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/event-stream');
  res.setHeader('Cache-Control', 'no-cache, no-transform');
  res.setHeader('Connection', 'keep-alive');
  res.setHeader('X-Accel-Buffering', 'no');

  res.write('data: {"type":"connected"}\n\n');  // Line 1903

  // Get question and context
  const questionVersion = await storage.getQuestionVersion(questionVersionId);

  Change to:
  // Set SSE headers
  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/event-stream');
  res.setHeader('Cache-Control', 'no-cache, no-transform');
  res.setHeader('Connection', 'keep-alive');
  res.setHeader('X-Accel-Buffering', 'no');

  res.write('data: {"type":"connected"}\n\n');
  // CRITICAL: Flush immediately so client receives the connection confirmation
  if ((res as any).flush) {
    (res as any).flush();
  }

  // Get question and context
  const questionVersion = await storage.getQuestionVersion(questionVersionId);

  Why this works: The flush forces the server to send the buffered data immediately
  to the client. Once the client receives the initial "connected" message, the fetch
  promise resolves, the ReadableStream is established, and subsequent chunks will
  flow through properly.

  This same fix should also be applied to the demo and mobile-view SSE endpoints at
  similar locations in the code.
